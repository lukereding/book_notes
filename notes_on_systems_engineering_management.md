## notes on _an elegant puzzle: systems of engineering management_

A general caveat: The author of this book is super thoughtful and methodical. But these are fundamentally all anecdotes based on things that or haven't worked for one guy.

A note: This is the most beautiful book I've read in terms of the design and diagrams.

Another note: Burn this book and leave the appendix and this book would still be worthwhile.

Another note: I didn't find the organizational scheme of the book compelling.

One main point of this book: Always be looking for gaps and how you can fill them. In your skills, the company, whatever.

### chapter 2: organizations

- Larson suggests that managers should support 6-8 engineers; managers of managers should support 4-6 managers. "Fewer than four is not a team."

- He suggests having _the same teams innovate and do maintenance_.

- The four states of a team: falling behind (add people) => treading water (reduce WIP) => repaying tech debt (add time) => innovating (add slack)

- In general: avoid moving team people teams. High fixed costs, team gelling takes awhile, etc.

- In times of rapid (startup) growth, you have a huge problem w/r/t hiring and maintaining: hiring takes a ton of time, training takes a ton of time, and only the people that have been both hired and trained and interview and train newbies

- Larson talks about _succession planning_, i.e., answering the question, "What would happen if I were to disappear?" I'm not sure why you would really do this unless you wanted a new role. The basic idea is to figure out everything you do and decide how you would delegate those tasks and to whom. 

### chapter 3: tools

- This dude _loves_ systems thinking. Any difficult problem is worth representing as a system.

- He has an interesting model for product management:
  - problem discovery: What's the user's pain? What's the user's purpose (see notes to _inmates_)? What are your competitors doing? What are your competitive advantages? Is there any compounding leverage you could create?
  - problem selection: What are the criteria / requirement's that are important? _Consider different time frames._ What are the industry trends? What will provide useful learnings for the future? What's the cost/benefit ratio for the project?
  - solution validation: Find reference users. Compare to how other people have solved the problem. Write a letter to the customer assuming you've tackled the problem: can you write it with enthusiasm? _Prefer experimentation over analysis/infinite research._

- He also introduces the idea of _visions_ and _strategies_, which I really like:
  - _strategies_ explain the tradeoffs and actions that will be taken to address a specific challenge. Since there will likely be many challenges, there can be many strategy documents. they consist of:
    - the diagnosis: answers: what's the problem we're solving? Should be very specific and thorough.
    - polices: a description of the general approach to take and the tradeoffs you're willing to make
    - actions: specific actions that will be taken to address the problem
  - _visions_ describe a future state. they are aspirational. they allow you to imagine a world without the current constraints. they consist of:
    - a vision statement. 1-2 sentences. should be memorable.
    - value proposition: what will this do? what will it allow you or others to achieve?
    - capabilities: what will the product need to do to fulfill the value prop?
    - solved constraints: what are the constraints you're operating under today that will no longer be an issue in the future?
    - future constraints: what are the constraints that will be present in the future but aren't present now?
    - reference materials
    - it should be _narrative_

- Good goals:
  - have a target
  - have a baseline (current level)
  - describe a trend (what has progress been recently?)
  - have a time frame

- There's a sizable section on driving org. change with metrics that I didn't get excited about

- 3.6 deals with how to run migrations

- Is a reorg the right tool? Need to be really thoughtful about it. Don't reorg if it doesn't solve a structural problem that can't be solved some other way.

- Career advice: identify the gaps between you and future you and work to fill those gaps in your current role. 

- Media advice: (1) answer the question you want to be asked, (2) be positive, (3) speak in threes

- Model for leading without authority (ha!): Model, document, share:
  - model: get a sense of the baseline, ideally using some date. introduce whatever you want to introduce. don't make a big deal about it. pitch it as a short-term thing. collect more data.
  - document: document what you did somewhere
  - share: don't ask everyone to adopt the practice, just say, "hey, here's what we did, here's what happened".
  - This seems to work better than a top-down mandate.

- There is no single best leadership strategy. Cultivate several and use the one that's most effective for the given problem.

- If you're forming a group to address something, think: size, interface, time commitment, selection, length of term, representation. Group anti-patterns: the status group, bottlenecked groups, domineering groups, inert groups

- Tips for presenting to Senior leadership:
  - start with the conclusion
  - frame why the topic matters
  - be narrative
  - prepare for sidetracks and detours
  - answer directly
  - know your data
  - "one of your aims is to provide a mental model of how you make decisions" => this is quite powerful
  - know the details
  - make a clear ask

- Putting it together:
  - tie topic to business value
  - historical narrative
  - the ask
  - the diagnosis with data
  - decision-making principles + your mental model of how you're thinking
  - what's next + timeline
  - again, the ask

### chapter 4: approaches

#### management philosophy

For starters:

- the golden rule
- make people own explicit areas of the work
- reward people for _finishing_ high-quality work
- lead from the front

Additions:

- relationships are important
- people over process
- do the hard thing
- your company > your team > you


- ways engineering managers get stuck:
  - only manage up (or down)
  - never manage up
  - optimize locally
  - don't spent time building relationships
  - define role too narrowly
  - abscond rather than delegate
  - mistake team size for impact
  - mistake title for impact
  - confuse authority with truth
  - don't trust the team enough to delegate to them
  - only see problems

- to partner with your manager:
  - know some things about each other
  - update those things
  - your manager should kn0w:
    - the problems you're facing
    - how busy you are
    -  what you like to work on
    - if you're making progress
    - professional goals / growth areas
    - how you think you're being measured 

### chapter 5: culture


### chapter 6: careers

There's a lot of interesting stuff in here about interviews that I'm skipping over here.

Calibrations, performance cycles, creating new roles etc.


### interesting quotations:

- "...you only get value from projects when they finish"
- "Taking the time to evaluate which problem to solve is one of the best predictors I've found of a team's long-term performance."
- "...with great relationships it's possible to solve almost anything."
- "With the right people, any process works, and with the wrong people, no process works."
- "Bad goals are indistinguishable from numbers."
