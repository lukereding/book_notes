# the crux
Rumelt

There were a lot of good ideas in this book. A lot of them were already echoed in good strategy / bad strategy. I found the organization of the book to be confusing, and some chapters seemed out of place and tangential (e.g., "use sharp analytical tools with care")

overall:
- "effective people gain insight through finding and concentrating attention on the crux of a challenge â€“ the part of the tangle of issues that is both very important and addressable (which can be overcome with reasonable surety)"
- strategy is often a product of asking 'what's going on here?', thinking about things through different lenses
- the most useful frame is what is (a) addressable and (b) critically important (the degree to which it threatens the existence of the company)
- strategy should result in a set od coherent actions
- strategy is not something that comes on a bumper sticker or can be thought about _before_ you ask the really hard questions about what the core problems you're facing are and how you're going to solve them. tools like porter's 5 forces can be useful to help you think about problems and areas of advantage through different frames which might allow you to arrive at a strategy, but they aren't strategy


other notes:
- from Kees Dorst: "experienced designers can be seen to engage with a novel problem situation by searching for the central paradox, asking themselves what it is, that makes the problem hard to solve. They only start working towards a solution once the nature of the core paradox has been established to their satisfaction."
- "you cannot deduce a good strategy from theory."
- when you have 'gnarly' situations, you can use collecting, clustering, and filtering to get to the heart of issues. (this is a common 'design thinking' type of exercise)
- a lot of this book comes down to thinking really hard about the problem you have; "He [John Dewey] wrote that the most reliable source of new design ideas is 'reflection' on a 'felt difficulty'". 
- addressable strategic challenge: what passes the addressability and critical importance filters
- on coherent actions: "In companies like Petzl, Coherence is the consequence of a deep narrow focus, assiduously avoiding product proliferations and growth for growth's sake"
- "the cost of coherence is saying no to many interests with reasonable values and arguments."
- there's a good section about coherence of actions at really large companies. he argues that actions should meet the test for minimum coherence: at the very least, actions should not directly interfere or conflict with each other
- diagnosis is asking "why" and "what" over and over again to focus on core challenges
- recognizing obstacles and goals is the start of all strategy 
- "in competition, we seek advantage, and it can come only from some asymmetry." you should always be asking what asymmetries can be turned into advantage
  - in information
  - in know-how / technical skill
  - in position / branding that others don't have
  - in efficiency
  - in management of systems 
- the solution to the crux is never more price competition or more investment in Bertrand markets (markets in which competition leads to prices declining to cash costs)
- to create advantage, you often have to bring about skills or ideas that have not yet been combined
- "But a goal set arbitrarily, without an analysis or understanding of a critical challenge or opportunity, is an unsupported goal. By contrast, a good goal is the result of effective strategy work that target certain actions that will move the organization forward."
- "strategy should be based on judgments gained by examining changes, problems, skills, resources, and opportunities." 
- he argues that most strategy and goals companies put forward are fundamentally accounting based, and really say things like "cut costs" and "grow revenue," which is like a coach telling a football team that they need to win by advancing the ball more yards than the other team
- he argues that most of what we've learning about decision-making in the last several decades is useful when thinking about hard problems of strategy: there are no clear and neat alternatives to choose from
