## notes on __writing for story__

One of, if not the best book on writing and story-telling I've read. The reason: Franklin focuses not just on the polish level of writing, which language nerds obsess over and for which most writing books are written, but he focuses on the levels that come above that. He focuses on the __story__.

Note that Franklin writes 'new nonfiction', i.e., narrative non-fiction, and that's the focus of the book. The lessons are, however, applicable widely.

### stalking the true short story

What's a story?

> a sequence of actions that occur when a sympathetic character encounters a complicating situation that he confronts and solves

(NB: 'Sympathetic' was the most interesting part of this definition, and though I think he's right, Franklin never expands on what he means.)

- __Complicatations__ are the core of the story. They are problems that a character encounters. Complications pose problems. Those problems should ideally be something that all humans can relate to. If they are physcial (i.e. involving external forces) they should also be psychological (i.e. involve internal forces). Complications must be basic to work. They must relate to the human condition. More more cliche, the better the complication works (think: love, hate, pain, death). 

- Complications are everywhere. Whenever someone changes their mind: complication. The character now has to re-align herself with her new worldview. Ask yourself: Why did this person do that? What was their motive? The answer will lie in a complication. __Anything people do with purpose is linked to a motivation, and motivations are linked to complications.__

- Complications produce tension because they introduce problems that need to be solved.

- A __resolutions__ is a change in a character that resolves the complication. Resolutions detroy tension. Resolutions __must__ be the product of the character's efforts. A resolution that comes about by an act of god is simply uninteresting and fails to resolve the complication satisfactorily.

- To find a good story, always be looking. Look in newspapers. Newspaper stories typical focus on interesting resolutions but leave out the complication and thus the interesting story.

- In general, stories have happy endings (think of Vonnegut's story arcs). The reader wants to see someone struggle with something and come out ahead. 

- __Action__ links the complication to the resolution. 

- __Character__ is the central element of any short story. Building a character doesn't mean building a complete character. It means probing the parts of the character that are in service of the specific story, and no more. 

- Ask why your character view the complication the way she does. They will probably take you into the past. A common structure for a story is the complication followed by a flashback that sheds light on this past.

- Once you have the complication, the actions, and resolution, ask: Did you character really fully understand the complication he faced? How have the actions changed your character? What conclusions did he draw from each action? Usually involves a __plot point__ where the character has a realization that brings them to the resolution.


### structure

- In writing there are three levels: the outline level (broad arc of the story), the structural level (what happens within each focus), and the polish level (grammar, imagery, word choice).

- Franklin argues that at a broad structural level, cliche is good, it is truth. Again, think of Vonnegut classifiying most stories into one of three narrative arcs.

- He argues that readers want a __story__ more than anything.

- The atoms of the story are __images__. For an image to be effective it must be based on a verb. Images can be passive or active. 

- A series of images forms a __focus__. These are the molecules of the story. The bonds that hold the images together are __transitions__. 

- Franklin argues there are typically five focuses in a short story
  - complicating focus. At the end of reading this, you have to have the reader hooked. If there is no tension that the reader will continue to read to learn how the tension is resolved, you don't have a story. 
  - three develop focuses. If there's a flashback, it's usually the first of these. Flashback won't work unless you've really motivated the reader; otherwise she won't care to expend the cognitive energy required for time traveling. The third focus contains the insight or plot point. 
  - the resolution focus. Should already read fast.


### the outline

#### practicality

- Remember the 'black box theory': what someone thinks is irrelevant; focus on what the person does. __Show, don't tell.__ Focus on the action.

Notable quotations:

> Many people never even manage to clearly recognize the complications that face them, so they don't have a prayer of dealing with them.

> Big things often don't relate to each other the way little ones do.
