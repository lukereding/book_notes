## notes on __writing for story__

One of, if not the best book on writing and story-telling I've read. The reason: Franklin focuses not just on the polish level of writing, which language nerds obsess over and for which most writing books are written, but he focuses on the levels that come above that. He focuses on the __story__.

Note that Franklin writes 'new nonfiction', i.e., narrative non-fiction, and that's the focus of the book. The lessons are, however, applicable widely.

### stalking the true short story

What's a story?

> a sequence of actions that occur when a sympathetic character encounters a complicating situation that he confronts and solves

(NB: 'Sympathetic' was the most interesting part of this definition, and though I think he's right, Franklin never expands on what he means.)

- __Complicatations__ are the core of the story. They are problems that a character encounters. Complications pose problems. Those problems should ideally be something that all humans can relate to. If they are physcial (i.e. involving external forces) they should also be psychological (i.e. involve internal forces). Complications must be basic to work. They must relate to the human condition. More more cliche, the better the complication works (think: love, hate, pain, death). 

- Complications are everywhere. Whenever someone changes their mind: complication. The character now has to re-align herself with her new worldview. Ask yourself: Why did this person do that? What was their motive? The answer will lie in a complication. __Anything people do with purpose is linked to a motivation, and motivations are linked to complications.__

- Complications produce tension because they introduce problems that need to be solved.

- A __resolutions__ is a change in a character that resolves the complication. Resolutions detroy tension. Resolutions __must__ be the product of the character's efforts. A resolution that comes about by an act of god is simply uninteresting and fails to resolve the complication satisfactorily.

- To find a good story, always be looking. Look in newspapers. Newspaper stories typical focus on interesting resolutions but leave out the complication and thus the interesting story.

- In general, stories have happy endings (think of Vonnegut's story arcs). The reader wants to see someone struggle with something and come out ahead. 

- __Action__ links the complication to the resolution. 

- __Character__ is the central element of any short story. Building a character doesn't mean building a complete character. It means probing the parts of the character that are in service of the specific story, and no more. 

- Ask why your character view the complication the way she does. They will probably take you into the past. A common structure for a story is the complication followed by a flashback that sheds light on this past.

- Once you have the complication, the actions, and resolution, ask: Did you character really fully understand the complication he faced? How have the actions changed your character? What conclusions did he draw from each action? Usually involves a __plot point__ where the character has a realization that brings them to the resolution.


### structure

- In writing there are three levels: the outline level (broad arc of the story), the structural level (what happens within each focus), and the polish level (grammar, imagery, word choice).

- Franklin argues that at a broad structural level, cliche is good, it is truth. Again, think of Vonnegut classifiying most stories into one of three narrative arcs.

- He argues that readers want a __story__ more than anything.

- The atoms of the story are __images__. For an image to be effective it must be based on a verb. Images can be passive or active. 

- A series of images forms a __focus__. These are the molecules of the story. The bonds that hold the images together are __transitions__. 

- Franklin argues there are typically five focuses in a short story
  - complicating focus. At the end of reading this, you have to have the reader hooked. If there is no tension that the reader will continue to read to learn how the tension is resolved, you don't have a story. 
  - three develop focuses. If there's a flashback, it's usually the first of these. Flashback won't work unless you've really motivated the reader; otherwise she won't care to expend the cognitive energy required for time traveling. The third focus contains the insight or plot point. 
  - the resolution focus. Should already read fast.


### the outline

- The goal of the outline is to realize the story you want to tell and have a destination. Often we begin writing, exciting by a topic or image, and have no idea where we're going. The result is what Franklin calls 'spaghettiing'. You don't have a destination, small details and images pile up until you get to a place that don't look like a sane destination.  

- The outline for a short story is five simple statements, one for each focus. Each statement is 2-3 words. Noun, verb, direct object. "Joe eats apple." "Man persists." "Man finds profession." "Woman learns." "Guilt drives woman." "Woman loves son."

- These statements represent what happens at the end each focus, not the beginning. The most dramatic part of anything is the end.

- For each focus statement ask:
  - Does the verb connote action? (Spend a while thinking about the right action verb.) If the verb is passive (be, was, did, should, thought), try again.
  - Is your main character in the statement?
  - Can you illustrate the event described?

- Then ask: Does the resolution solve the complication? Does it solve a different or related problem instead? If it does, your story won't work.

- Then ask: Are any of these statement irrelevant? Does each contribute unambiguously to the progression of the story?

### structuring the rough

- Three kinds of __narrative__:
  - Transitional. Serves to ensure the reader enters the world of the story and stays there. Switches between scenes, keeps the reader oriented. 
  - Preparatory. Steps up for the climax / resolution. It's setting up dramatic close-up action. Tell the reader what she needs to know for the resolution to have maximum impact.
  - Climactic. Focuses tightly on events. Lets action explode. It doesn't describe emotion, it evokes emotion.

- Narrative threads:
  - time
  - place
  - character
  - mood
  - subject

- A good story establishes these narrative threads early on in the story and maintains them.

- Transitions should not annouce themselves. A transition done right is a transition the reader doesn't realize exists.

- Three types of major transitions:
  - break transition. Mostly lazy. Uses * * * to determine a scene break.
  - flashback.
  - the "River City" transition. A transition that appeals to emotion (?) but doesn't really make logical sense, but the reader doesn't notice.

- Franklin is a proponent of __foreshadowing__. By knowing the story's destination ahead of time, you can more effective foreshadow that elements early in the story that are important later on.

- Think __pace__ and __intensity__ and how the two interplay in your story.

- Always make sure the outline matches your story and vice versa. It's okay to change the outline. The process of writing the story will sometimes make real story more clear and require a revised outline.

- __Woodwork__ aka your darlings. Franklin says to murder them, even though this will be some of your best writing. But if it doesn't contribute to the story, it has to go. Or, maybe it's a symptom that you're telling the wrong story.

### polishing

- The most over-emphasized part of writing.

- You have to know the rules to break them.

- The lead, or narrative hook, is simply a transition between the reader's world and the world of your story. If you know where your story is going, the lead shouldn't be terribly difficult. It should set the narrative threads up and make a cleear connection to the readers world by creating images thee reader can identify with. 

- Create images from action verbs. If your image contains lots of modifiers, you aren't using the right words.

- It is through details and the specific in our images that we acheive the universal.

- To achieve smoothness arrange images so as to decrease the cognitive friction on the part of the reader. The reader should be able to easily move from one image to the next. 

### the nature of art and artists

- Franklin argues that in order to see truth in the world, we have to kill ourselves off in a way. In order to see, we must remove the beliefs and prejudguces that filter how, as individuals, look at the world. We must seek clarity. We must not bend reality to what we want to see. "The object is no longer to write clearly but to see clearly." The idea being that art is an exercise in seeing the world for what it is but in order to do so we must shed that which makes us _us_. 

- The reader doesn't want reality. The reader knows reality. It is messy and confusing. The reader turns to the writer for a distillation of something more important. It's the writer's job to do the distilling. 


#### practicality

- Remember the 'black box theory': what someone thinks is irrelevant; focus on what the person does. __Show, don't tell.__ Focus on the action.

- Write the end of the story first. Start with the climatic scene, then write what leads up to it. Rewrite. Get it right. Then write the fourth focus. Then the complicating focus. Then the first two development focuses. The reason is that the story hinges on the ending, so you have to get that right first.

- After the initial draft, put your story away for a few days. Then read it. Doesn't it make you feel anything? If not, something is wrong.
