# The successful manager

Potter and Kavanagh

This was--to my surprise--probably one of the best books on management I've read. It's not a thick book, but it's very to-the-point, don't have a lot of extra fluff or information like most of the business-related books. Tons of useful practice advice, a lot of which I hadn't read elsewhere.

### chapter 1

- Becoming a top-tier manager is a very high-leverage position
- You want high trust and high performance from your team
- Self awareness is one of the most important qualities you need as a manager to understand where you can improve

### chapter 2: characteristics of great managers

- TEACHER:
- Transparent
  - ensure everyone is working from the same information and context -- able to source info / decisions across your team
  - sheilding your team from bad news and failing to communicate authentically can risk eroding your team's trust
  - always make it clear to your team _why_ you're doing something -- make your decision-making transparent to them
  - a big part of transparency is just ensuring people have the right context
- Empathetic
  - every employee wants to ho be heard and valued and understood
  - empathy is foundational to trust
  - take a learning stance: be curious! think about what it would be like to be in their situation
  - ask more questions to guide the team to an answer as opposed to dictating or lecturing
- Adaptable
  - adaptable managers drive greater productivity through their orientation towards improving things rather than defaulting to, "that's the way things have always been done"
  - Adaptable managers tailor their management style to different people's working styles
  - adaptable managers are open to going with other peoples approaches and perspectives even if it's not the way they would do things
  - they recognize the importance of giving team members enough freedom and power to make their own choices, even if that sometimes means allowing them to go with a less than ideal approach
  - don't provide answers to all your team members
- Clear Communicator
  - you are often have to tailor your communication to the individuals involved, or to the situation
  - even if you communicates something clearly, there's a good chance somebody may misunderstand or misinterpreted your intended message. "As a manager and a leader, you increasingly see that it doesn't matter where I communication breakdown happens; instead, you realize they need to judge the success of your communication based on how effectively it is received"
  - It's rare that we over-communicate
  - it can help to define success for a given communication activity:
    - what do i want the other person to know?
    - what do i want the other person to feel?
    - what do i want the other person to do?
  - A little preparation can take you a long way
- Humble
   - arrogance is always a weakness
   - a humble manager does not need to be right. They placed a higher value on what is true then on their opinion
   - when you're willing to share your mistakes and what you doing wrong in the past, and how you recovered and dealt with those mistakes, you help build trust from your team
 - Empowering
   - "the more involved you need to be int he day-to-day tasks of each of your team member's jobs, the less you are able to focus on the aspects that are unique to your leadership role, such as setting the direction of your group, working with your peers, and managing up"
   - Your job is not to solve all the problems between members present to you.
   - Your job is to help break down barriers that your team members can't solve on their own
   - every time you solve a problem they can't solve, they become more dependent on you, and less autonomous
     - are they just venting?
     - is it something they are capable of solving? turn it back on them
     - can they solve it with a little coaching?
   - "The best help you can provide in a given situation is to use it as an opportunity to build employees on problem-solving skills, to guide them towards increasing by goals of independence and autonomy, and were necessary, to step in to swiftly tackle those barriers that only you can break down"
 - Responsive
   - it's often said someone's success is determine by their availability, affability, and ability
   - if they get what they need from you quickly, they're be back on track
   - responsiveness is also involved in trust


### chapter 3: goals

- three types of goals:
  - mission. should answer the questions, "What were you brought in to achieve?" and "were you successful in achieving it?"
  - performance
    - results / outcome goals. Focus on the specific outcomes
    - process goals. Focuses on intermediate steps that support an outcome goal
  - development
- expectations vs. goals
  - expectations are more around _how_ employees should go about things, e.g., standards to follow, working hours to keep, attitudes to embody, etc.
- SMART goals
- results goals are important, but are typically determined by forces outside the employee's center of control. define process goals in such a narrow way that they are entirely within an employee's control
- three goals is plenty; more than five is too many
- use quarterly objectives for goals is probably the best time frame, as things typically change a lot over the course of a year
- "superb leaders have clarity about where they want to go in the form of a vision in strategy, they constantly socialize it within and beyond their teams, and they have an achievable plan for how to get there, and they demonstrate their ability to deliver on expectations by executing against that plan"


### chapter 4: prioritization, delegation, time management

- prioritization
  - lack of prioritization is a common employee complaint
  - in some cases there are too many, or they haven't been messaged correctly
  - "to be a top manager, you need to constantly exercise your critical thinking capability, taking a step back asking yourself questions such as, "are we still aiming in the right direction? Has anything viral changed since we establish the priorities? Do our current priority still reflect the most important things for us to execute on?""
  - the best managers consistently oscillate between the big picture in the granular, checking in to ensure things are on course of the strategic level, then talking back down to a more granular level
  - the way prioritization becomes real is through resource allocation
- delegation
  - new managers often struggle with delegation
  - it also take some people time to get used to asking other people to do things for them. This is a common feeling them a new managers, and natural weed weeds many managers avoiding asking for support from their team in certain cases
  - delegate non-urgent, important work items, and urgent unimportant items
  - your job as a leader is to drive the performance of the organization through optimal allocation of resources
  -  when delegating, be very specific about the timeframe within which you need something completed, and spell out any process-oriented requests. check in with your direct and make sure the request is clear
-  time management
   - assume that 1/3 of your day will be spent dealing with things you didn't expect to have on your plate when you woke up that morning
   - Time management is about the discipline of giving attention where attention is du
   - as much as possible, systematize aspects of your team's execution of day-to-day tasks
   - everyone's juggling a lot, but it's important to be able to distinguish between rubber and glass balls: what tasks are mission-critical that you really can't overlook, and which will be okay for you to drop?


### chapter 5: coaching, feedback, and writing reviews

- formal vs ongoing
- general advice
  - what are you trying to accomplish with feedback? you want the employee to feel as good as possible about things, but at the same time, you also want to make sure it's clear to them how to change (or not change) their actions to improve their performance
  - feedback must be grounded in specific, real-world examples
  - good managers are constantly observing and recording things their employees do as specific examples to refer to later on
  - feedback should be important enough to mention it: don't give feedback over really small things that don't matter: it should reach some threshold where it's starting to impact deliverables or performance in some way.
  - all feedback needs to be actionable
  - use the SBIS framework:
    - Situation - Set context
    - Behavior - What did the person do?
    - Impact - What impact did that action have?
    - Solution - What's the suggested action or next step? Can you work with the person to think of any other next steps?
  - you can use SBIS for positive or negative feedback. For positive feedback, it helps the person understand why they did something well
  - give 6 pieces of positive feedback for every negative piece of feedback
  - feedback should be fairly timely -- you don't want to be super reactive, but you do want it to occur soon after the fact
  - feedback should be given in private
- mistakes when giving feedback
  - trying to give too much feedback at once
  - nitpicking
  - judging the individual rather than the actions
  - being too vague
  - the crap sandwich
- useful questions to solicit feedback from your directs:
  - how can i better support you in specific workstreams / projects / etc.
  - what was one thing your last manager did that you liked that I don't do?
  - what is one thing I can do differently?
  - is there anything you prefer I not do?

### chapter 6: tailoring your managing style

- great manager are adaptive
- to become a top-tier manager, the goal is not to hone your specific _way_ of managing--there is no one-size-fits all approach
- you'll want to adjust your management style to the individual and role, based on these three dimensions:
  - how competent is the person?
  - how confident is the person?
  - to what degree does the person desire autonomy vs. support?
- competent
  - as someone becomes more and more competent, you can give them more and more autonomy; your goal is to shift them to become as autonomous as possible
  - ask lots of open-ended questions: "how would you approach this?", "what do you recommend we do here?"
  - competent is not something general: it applies to every skill, task, etc.
- confidence
  - might be useful to think of combinations of competence and confidence:
    - low confidence, low competence: learner
    - low confidence, high competence: capable but cautious performer => lots of praise via SBIS framework
    - high confidence, low competence: enthusiastic beginner => this can be a tricky situation, because they need a lot of oversight but might resist it because they don't think they need it
    - high confidence, high competence: self-reliant achiever 

### chapter 7: motivating and inspiring your team

- three things to focus on:
  - capture their hearts - there needs to be a _cause_ that the team can rally behind. if you're struggling, ask _why_ questions, tie it to a bigger picture or overriding mission
  - capture their minds - what's being asked of them has to be clear, actionable, tangible
  - align performance criteria and incentives 
- great leaders are change agents and lead by example - player-coach
  - aren't afraid to do the work, are willing to 'dive into the trenches'
  - act the way you want others to act
  - be collaborative
    - the simplest, most powerful way to do this is to ask: "what do you think?"
  - empower people 
    - a lot of this comes down to giving people autonomy to make decisions, which drives intrinsic motivation
  - give credit, take blame
  - be liberal with your praise!

### chapter 8: managing laterally and up

- as you move higher up (managing teams), it becomes more important to spend time with people _outside_ the team
  - this is probably more important in larger organizations
  - you need to be out there championing the cause, securing support, driving alignment, communicating progress
- managing up
  - you want to make your manager's life easier. really, you want to make your manager, and everyone above her, look good: everyone wins
  - in general, your manager cares about four things:
    - the major issues they need to know about
    - the status of key projects or deliverables
    - bandwidth / resourcing challenges
    - how your team is doing
  - you need to have an open and honest dialogue with your manager - no issue should be out of bounds
  - always come prepared
    - treat your manager's time with respect. be solution-oriented! __don't come to your manager with problems: come with recommendations__
    - execute and circle back. execute on any suggestions your manager has and make sure you circle back to show that you actually took what they said to heart


### chapter 9: building an A team

- the 80/20 rule also applies to work done in an org, e.g., 20% of the people are producing 80% of the output
- __don't neglect coaching top talent__ -- there's a tendency to focus coaching on low performers, but really getting the most out of your top talent can add 2-5x value relative to coaching investment in a middle-line performer
- you can improve people's performance through development and coaching, but not everyone will be able to get to the highest levels of performance
- when hiring, know that it's hard to train for things like growth potential, attitude, mindset, self-awareness, and all the soft skills that generally set people apart
- ideally, when hiring, you want to think deeply about the role you want the person to do, and translate that into a document you can give to a recruiter
- when it comes to promos, it can be frustrating if there's no clear path for promo, or if the criteria for promo are arbitrary and vague. try to be as specific as possible here about what it means to be performing at the next level. 
- keeping low performers on your team dampens morale, and sends a message that it's okay to do shoddy work

### chapter 11: challenges new manager face

- decision-making is a skill that can honed with any other
- new managers need to be very cognizant of the ripple effects of their decisions: managers are in a situation where decisions have much broader impact and can have unexpected second- or third-order impacts
- managing can be overwhelming
  - focus on keeping calm and building systems for how you operate effectively, learn the art of delegation, learn how to let go of control, focus on building up your team

### chapter 13: determining if it's time to leave

Consider these criteria:

- Do I enjoy the work itself?
- Do I like the people?
- Am I fairly paid?
- Is it meeting my development / professional needs?
- Do I have work/life balance?

Start putting feelers out if you can only check three of these boxes.
