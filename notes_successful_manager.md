# The successful manager

Potter and Kavanagh

This was--to my surprise--probably one of the best books on management I've read. It's not a thick book, but it's very to-the-point, don't have a lot of extra fluff or information like most of the business-related books. Tons of useful practice advice, a lot of which I hadn't read elsewhere.

### chapter 1

- Becoming a top-tier manager is a very high-leverage position
- You want high trust and high performance from your team
- Self awareness is one of the most important qualities you need as a manager to understand where you can improve

### chapter 2: characteristics of great managers

- TEACHER:
- Transparent
  - ensure everyone is working from the same information and context -- able to source info / decisions across your team
  - sheilding your team from bad news and failing to communicate authentically can risk eroding your team's trust
  - always make it clear to your team _why_ you're doing something -- make your decision-making transparent to them
  - a big part of transparency is just ensuring people have the right context
- Empathetic
  - every employee wants to ho be heard and valued and understood
  - empathy is foundational to trust
  - take a learning stance: be curious! think about what it would be like to be in their situation
  - ask more questions to guide the team to an answer as opposed to dictating or lecturing
- Adaptable
  - adaptable managers drive greater productivity through their orientation towards improving things rather than defaulting to, "that's the way things have always been done"
  - Adaptable managers tailor their management style to different people's working styles
  - adaptable managers are open to going with other peoples approaches and perspectives even if it's not the way they would do things
  - they recognize the importance of giving team members enough freedom and power to make their own choices, even if that sometimes means allowing them to go with a less than ideal approach
  - don't provide answers to all your team members
- Clear Communicator
  - you are often have to tailor your communication to the individuals involved, or to the situation
  - even if you communicates something clearly, there's a good chance somebody may misunderstand or misinterpreted your intended message. "As a manager and a leader, you increasingly see that it doesn't matter where I communication breakdown happens; instead, you realize they need to judge the success of your communication based on how effectively it is received"
  - It's rare that we over-communicate
  - it can help to define success for a given communication activity:
    - what do i want the other person to know?
    - what do i want the other person to feel?
    - what do i want the other person to do?
  - A little preparation can take you a long way
- Humble
   - arrogance is always a weakness
   - a humble manager does not need to be right. They placed a higher value on what is true then on their opinion
   - when you're willing to share your mistakes and what you doing wrong in the past, and how you recovered and dealt with those mistakes, you help build trust from your team
 - Empowering
   - "the more involved you need to be int he day-to-day tasks of each of your team member's jobs, the less you are able to focus on the aspects that are unique to your leadership role, such as setting the direction of your group, working with your peers, and managing up"
   - Your job is not to solve all the problems between members present to you.
   - Your job is to help break down barriers that your team members can't solve on their own
   - every time you solve a problem they can't solve, they become more dependent on you, and less autonomous
     - are they just venting?
     - is it something they are capable of solving? turn it back on them
     - can they solve it with a little coaching?
   - "The best help you can provide in a given situation is to use it as an opportunity to build employees on problem-solving skills, to guide them towards increasing by goals of independence and autonomy, and were necessary, to step in to swiftly tackle those barriers that only you can break down"
 - Responsive
   - it's often said someone's success is determine by their availability, affability, and ability
   - if they get what they need from you quickly, they're be back on track
   - responsiveness is also involved in trust


### chapter 3: goals

- three types of goals:
  - mission. should answer the questions, "What were you brought in to achieve?" and "were you successful in achieving it?"
  - performance
    - results / outcome goals. Focus on the specific outcomes
    - process goals. Focuses on intermediate steps that support an outcome goal
  - development
- expectations vs. goals
  - expectations are more around _how_ employees should go about things, e.g., standards to follow, working hours to keep, attitudes to embody, etc.
- SMART goals
- results goals are important, but are typically determined by forces outside the employee's center of control. define process goals in such a narrow way that they are entirely within an employee's control
- three goals is plenty; more than five is too many
- use quarterly objectives for goals is probably the best time frame, as things typically change a lot over the course of a year
- "superb leaders have clarity about where they want to go in the form of a vision in strategy, they constantly socialize it within and beyond their teams, and they have an achievable plan for how to get there, and they demonstrate their ability to deliver on expectations by executing against that plan"


### chapter 4: prioritization, delegation, time management

- prioritization
  - lack of prioritization is a common employee complaint
  - in some cases there are too many, or they haven't been messaged correctly
  - "to be a top manager, you need to constantly exercise your critical thinking capability, taking a step back asking yourself questions such as, "are we still aiming in the right direction? Has anything viral changed since we establish the priorities? Do our current priority still reflect the most important things for us to execute on?"
  - the best managers consistently oscillate between the big picture in the granular, checking in to ensure things are on course of the strategic level, then talking back down to a more granular level
  - the way prioritization becomes real is through resource allocation
- delegation
  - new managers often struggle with delegation
  - it also take some people time to get used to asking other people to do things for them. This is a common feeling them a new managers, and natural weed weeds many managers avoiding asking for support from their team in certain cases
  - delegate non-urgent, important work items, and urgent unimportant items
  - your job as a leader is to drive the performance of the organization through optimal allocation of resources
  -  when delegating, be very specific about the timeframe within which you need something completed, and spell out any process-oriented requests. check in with your direct and make sure the request is clear
-  time management
   - assume that 1/3 of your day will be spent dealing with things you didn't expect to have on your plate when you woke up that morning
   - Time management is about the discipline of giving attention where attention is du
   - as uch as possible, systematize aspects of your team's execution of day-to-day tasks
