# smart choices
Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa


They use the acronym PrOACT:
**Pr**oblem
**O**bjectives
**A**lternatives
**C**onsequences
**T**radeoffs

plus: Uncertainty, Risk, and Linked decisions

Each element gets its own chapter.

## problem

> A good solution to a well-posed decision problem is almost always a smarter choice than an excellent solution to a poorly posed one.

Take some time here. It's easy to state the problem in the easiest way, or the way that comes to your mind first, but being lazy about your problem definition will lead to subpar outcomes. Is your problem really about buying a new house, or it is about investing your money wisely? Or maybe it's about providing a safer environment for your kids. The point is, be clear with yourself about what problem you're _really_ trying to solve.

- Ask what triggered the decision. Most decision problems have a _trigger_: the thing that makes the decision necessary. For your decision problem, what's the trigger?

- Question the constraints in your problem.

- Identify the essential elements of the problem

- Understand any relation decisions that depend on this decision.

Always reaxamine the problem statement as you go. Is the world still the same? Is this still the right problem to be solving?


### objectives

Objectives:

- help you figure out what information to gather
- help explain your decision to others
- determine a decision's importance

A common trap is focus on objectives that are easy to quantify and objectives that are important in the short-term but not the long-term. Don't do this! All the objectives that are important should be taken into consideration, whether or not they can be quantified easily (see below for a way around this). The authors ask us to probe seemingly obvious objectives--this helps us reveal what _actually_ matters to us.

Steps: 

1. Write down all the concerns you hope to address. 
2. Convert the concerns nto succinct objectives (e.g. develop creatively, remain physically active, learn discipline)
3. Separate ends from means to establish your fundamental objectives. Having leather seats in your car is means to an end (having a comfortable and attractive interior). For each objective, keep asking "why?"
4. Clarify what you  mean by each objective. 
5. Tests you objectives to see if they capture your interests. 

### alternatives

> the payoff from seeking good, new, creative alternatives can be extremely high

(This reminds me of the distinction between [_creating_ and _claiming_ value in negoiations](https://github.com/lukereding/book_notes/blob/master/notes_on_judgement_in_managerial_dm.md#making-rational-decisions-in-negotiations)--there's so much more to gain by creating value, but it means being creative about alternatives.)

Keys to generating better alternatives:

- Use your objectives--ask "how?" Ask "how can I achieve the objectives I've set?" for each of your objectives.

- Challenge constraints. Try assuming the constraint doesn't exist, then create alternatives that reflect its absence. If the alternatives created this way are really appealing, maybe there's a way around the constraint. 

- Set high aspirations

- Learn from experience

- Ask others for suggestions

- Give your subconscious time to operate. Reminds of something Bertand Russell wrote, to the effect of: when he had a problem to solve or something he needed to write, he'd often think about really hard for a few hours, then step away and not think about it for a week, and then come back to consider it and find that his subconscious had already done the work for him.

- Create alternatives, then evaluate. This mirrors more general advice about separating the creation of ideas from their evaluation. 

### consequences

> be sure you really understand the consequences of your alternatives before you make a choice

Mirrors lessons in other books (_principles_, _zero to one_) about thinking through the second- and third-order effects of things.

Build a consequences table:

1. Mentally put yourself into the future. 

2. Create a free-form description of the consequences of each alternative. 

3. Eliminate any clear inferior alternatives. 

4. Organize descriptions of the remaining alternatives into a consequences table. Put alternatives as the columns and objectives as the rows; in each cell put the consequence. It's okay if some of these are hard to quantify; just be consistent in the words and terminology that you use.

### tradeoffs

Find and eliminate dominated alternatives. If A is better than B on some objectives and no worse than B on all the others, then B can be eliminated. This is easier to see if you convert your consequences table into a _ranking_ table where the cells of the matrix are ranks instead of numbers / descriptions. 

Use _evan swaps_:

1. Determine the change necessary to concel out an objective
2. Assess what change in another objective would compensate for the needed change
3. Make the swap
4. Cancel out the now-irrelevant alternative.
5. Eliminate the dominated alternative. 

Basically, you're quantifying how you want to make some of your tradeoffs, and using this information to eliminate alternatives. 

- Make the easier swaps first
- Concentrate on the amount of the swap, not how important the objective is
- Make consistent swaps


### uncertainty

Really important point, one that comes up in _principle_, _thinking in bets_, and other books:

> Whenever uncertainty exists, there can be guarantee that smart choice will lead to good consequences

Sometimes we make really good decisions that turn out badly; sometimes the converse happens. 'Decisions under uncertainty should be judged by the quality of the decision making, not by the quality of the consequences'.

Use _risk profiles_ to capture key information about uncertainty:

- What are the key uncertainties?
- What are the possible outcomes? The outcomes should be MECE.
- What are the chances of each outcome?
- What are the consequences of each outcome?

You can experiment with decision trees, where the leaves are the outcomes that lead to a table of consequences, assuming each of those outcomes happens. 


### risk tolerance
