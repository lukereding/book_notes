## good strategy // bad strategy

this was a good book though the tone at the author at times was holier-than-thou and overly arrogant.

main points:

- strategy is about __focus__.
- most 'strategies' you see aren't actually strategies

### intro

a strategy is a __cohesive__ response to a challenge. a good strategy acknowledges a problem and __provides an approach to solving the problem__. It is clear about the tradeoffs being made. 

### chapter 1: good strategy is unexpected

the point point of this chapter is that leaders need to be willing to __focus__ in order to execute a strategy: good strategy is about saying 'no' to a lot of different options. it's only by focusing that you can get to a cohesive and coordinated set of responses to a problem.

### chapter 3: bad strategy

hallmarks of bad strategy include:

- fluff
- failure to face the challenge. failure to clearly define what the challenge is. "if you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don't have a strategy. Instead, you either have a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen."
- mistaking goals for strategy. a strategy should answer the question of __how__. 
- bad strategic objectives. objectives are 'bad' when they don't address the challenge or are impractical

interesting distinction: __goals__ are overall values and desires (e.g. for a football team, to win the game), whereas __objectives__ are specific operational targets (e.g. throw three touchdowns). 

### chapter 4: why so much bad strategy?

good strategy involves focus, and thus choice, and thus saying 'no' to many worlds of possibilities. typically the choices to make are hard, underwise you probably wouldn't need a strategy. bad strategy usually comes about because people are unwilling or unable to make those hard choices.

### chapter 5: kernel of good strategy

The kernel of any strategy contains:

- a __diagnosis__ that defines the problem. "diagnosis is a judgment about the meaning of facts." "good strategy tends to be based on the diagnosis promising leverage over outcomes." the diagnosis needs to define the problem __in a way that is actionable__. defining a problem that you can't solve directly, even if it is a major problem, it's useful because you can't do anything about it.
- a __guiding policy__ that defines the overall approach for dealing with the challenge. the guiding policy is a set of guardrails: it constrains the action space. it "creates advantage by _anticipating_ the actions and reactions of others, by _reducing the complexity and ambiguity_ in the situation, by exploiting the _leverage_ inherent in concentrating the effort on a pivotal or decisive aspect of the situation, and by creating policies and actions that are _coherent_, each building on the pother rather than canceling once another out."
- a __set of coherent actions__ that is used to carry out the guiding policy

### chapter 6: using leverage

leverage comes from anticipating what will happen, understanding what is most important, and applying consistent, coordinated effort.

### chapter 7: proximate objectives

a good proximate objective has to be feasible. most problems we're trying to solve are very complex. part of the job of a leader is to absorb a lot of that complexity and distill it down into something that is solvable and feasible.

the more uncertainty there is, the more proximate an objective should be.

in many cases, you might have a series of objectives in which it only makes sense to talk about the second objective if you've successfully completed the first.

### chapter 8: chain-link systems

a system has chain-link characteristics when the overall performance of the system is determined by the weakest component of the system. 

if some components are working really well but the overall output is still subpar, you might have a chain-link system.

to fix a broken chain-link system, identify the bottlenecks / components that are underperforming. then address each component at a time.

chain-link system can be a source of competitive advantage, e.g., ikea. take any component from the system and there is no advantage; the benefit comes from the interaction effects of all the components working together.

example: _limiting factors_, e.g., a house's location will always be a limiting factor to its value. no matter how great the house is, the location will constrain the desirability of the house. removing limiting factors can be a powerful skill (connection to system thinking primer, ecology, law of the minimum, rate-limiting steps in reactions)

### chapter 9: using design

"Today...many effective strategies are more designs that decisions--are more constructed than chosen."

one interesting idea in this chapter comes from the interplay between design and competition / resource availability. if resources are fixed and competition is intense, the greater the need for a designed response that closely integrates available resources and actions. if you have a lot of resources / little competition, it makes less sense to have a tightly integrated, designed strategy

he also brings up the idea of _strategic resources_, resources that a company has that give it an advantage; other companies that try to duplicate it would incur a net loss.

### chapter 10: focus

to understand a company's strategy, don't listen to what it says its strategy is. look at that company's policies and determine how those polices differ from typical policies. then try to figure out how those polices work together: what are they aiming towards?

### chapter 12: using advantage

"In real rivalry, there are an uncountable number of asymmetries. It is the leader's job to identify which asymmetries are critical--which can be turned into important advantages."

really interesting example for nut growers in CA. basically, this guy got into nut farming in CA. on the surface, this seems like a terrible plan. farming is super variable, you have little control over yields, etc. but his thought was: if you're big enough, then you can do research and find ways of increasing your yield. at the same time, we try to manufacture greater demand for our products. when demand increases, we're there to serve it. importantly, there's a big delay between the time (a) you decide you want to become a nut farmer to capitalize on the increased demand and (b) when you actually start producing nuts (~10 years). by that time, the game's already over because the big dog has a huge advantage over you, have even more land, is doing more research on increasing yields, etc. note that the concept of a delay is really important here as it is in most systems.

If you want to increase value, your strategy either

- deepen extant advantages
- broaden extant advantages
- manufacture demand
- strengthen isolating mechanisms that block knock-offs (think: patents)

another interesting example of the gilbreth brick technique. gilbreth doubled efficiency in brick-laying not by fundamentally changing anything but by studying the process and making small tweaks to each component in the process. this is one way you can deepen advantages you already possess.

### chapter 13: using dynamics

this chapter is broadly about how to exploit 'waves' or systematic changes in your industry. the most interesting part of the chapter is are the guideposts he uses to understand what's really happening during a time of change:

- rising fixed costs. might mean that the industry is going to consolidate
- deregulation. business will tend to stick to what they've done in the past even though the rules of the game have changed (e.g. what happened to many airlines after deregulation).
- predictable biases (not sure this fits in with the others). (1) durable products have rapid growth followed by a steep decline. the faster the growth, the faster the saturation. (2) most people are biased to think that the future winners will look like the current winners.
- incumbent response. companies in valuable positions will tend to stay the course even if the rules change
- attractor states. it's helpful to have a clear view about where an industry is headed in the long run--its attractor state

### chapter 13: inertia and entropy

you can use the inertia of other companies to your advantage. 

if there is inertia that's slowing you down as a company, the first step is to simplify. strip out components that are nonessential and extra layers of admin

the idea of a _hump chart_ to identify the parts of a whole that are underperforming is partly interesting but mostly trivial. can be used whenever you can assign profit / revenue  to individual segments, products, areas, etc. makes it clear where gains would be if you eliminated certain products, areas, etc.


### chapter 16: the science of strategy

a strategy is a hypothesis about the world. the execution of the strategy becomes an experiment. a good strategy is an __educated guess__; it doesn't claim to know something for sure. it's okay not to have complete certainty. good strategy is necessary experimental and pragmatic.

we have to refine our mental models about how the world works after observing the execution of the strategy. "the anomalies are not in nature but in the mind of the acute observer, revealed by a comparison between the facts and refined expectations"

example of Starbucks continually changing its strategy and how it operated early on. experiment -> observe -> decide what to change -> experiment, etc.

### chapter 17: using your head

really simple, but can be useful to pull back and ask, 'what's the most important things for my to be working on?' or 'what are the important important goals for my company'. the exercise itself is useful because it forces you to identify those things which are both __important__ and __actionable__. important to step back and free yourself from your own myopia: "being strategic largely means being less myopic than your undeliberative self."

techniques for crafting strategies:

- the kernel
- "sift your attention from _what_ is being done to _why_ it is being done, from the directions chosen to the problems that these choices address"
- new alternate strategies should address the weakness of any prevailing strategies; they should be slight tweaks on it. they should address the tradeoffs in different ways.

## interesting quotations

> When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons for the underperformance.

from General Georges F. Doriot:

> Without action, the world would be an idea.

> the anomalies are not in nature but in the mind of the acute observer, revealed by a comparison between the facts and refined expectations

> Our own myopia is the obstacle common to all strategic solutions.
