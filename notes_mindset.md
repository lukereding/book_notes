# Mindset

Dweck

The core thesis of the book is that there are, as a generalization, two mindsets. The growth mindset sees our abilities as fixed. The **fixed mindset** creates an urgency to prove oneself repeatably. Failure in the fixed mindset is very scary, because it means that we don't have the skills or traits we thought we have. We might avoid challenges because we might fail and threaten our self-image. The **growth mindset**, conversly, believes that we have the power to change through effort. The growth mindset emphasizes learning and sees failure as an oppurtunity to take stock and improve.

We all have both fixed and growth mindsets inside of us. The idea is to recognize the limitations of the fixed mindset, understand what triggers it, and more to a place where the growth mindset can be applied more naturally.

- Praise effort, not talent / innateness, to promote a growth mindset. Note, though, that any effort should be praised. For example, if effort is not applied correctly, or not getting you anywhere, you need to work on praising the _process_ of effort, learning from mistakes or failures, then trying again.
- Both positive and negative labels can mess with your mind -- failure of not meeting a positive label or meeting a negative one. Labels tends to associated with fixed mindsets.
- "He had no concept of failure" - this is what it's like to be something than embodys the growth mindset
- The fixed mindset if often about establishing supiority
- McEnroe as a great example of someone with a fixed mindset -- he bought a beautiful guitar, but destroyed it after hearing Buddy Guy play. He couldn't stand the thought that someone was that much better than him, and he'd rather not play at all if someone could be that much better than he was
- In business:
  - Businesses often talk about searching for 'talent'--this is textbook fixed mindset, the idea that people can't change or develop
  - Fixed mindset leaders are status-obsessed, use the company to affirm their superiority, put people down.
  - Fixed mindset creates groupthink -- the leader is seen as infallible, true, and there's no point disagreeing
  - Growth leaders debate, ask qustions, face failures, improve. Allows for shared credit, team-building, "we" not "I"
- A growth mindset is about forgiving, acceptance, moving on. A rejection doesn't reveal something innate about your character
- Needing to work at it isn't a sign that a relationship can't work
- "choosing a partner is choosing a set of problems"
- Praising children for their intelligence harms their motivation and performance => aversion to challenges that could shatter or threaten this view they now have of themselves
- When a child doesn't perform to their expectations, telling them "you didn't deserve to win" is actually better than other responses because it emphasizes effort and suggests that winning is a result of hard work and sustained effort
- when kinds mess up, don't blame some innate trait, focus on what they can do next time
- "challenge and nuture"
- _Beware of succcess_: it can put you in a fixed mindset and make you complacent
- Only praise _real_ effort, and praise the process: work, fail, improve, try again, not any effort
