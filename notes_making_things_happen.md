# _making things happens_
Scott Berkun


This was a great read. Lots of interesting thoughts and good advice.

This book is all about project management : 

> leading the team in figuring out what the project is (panning, scheduling, and requirements gathers), shepherding the project through design and development work (communication, decision making, and mid-game strategy), and driving the project through completition (leadership, crisis management, and end-game strategy).


## schedules

Schedules have three purposes:

1. communicate committments about when things will be done

2. encourage folks to see their work as parts of a greater whole

3. provide a tool to track progress and break up work

The _rule of thirds_: break up the available time into thirds
    - design
    - implementation
    - testing

## why schedules fail

- most people are optimistic planners
- precision != accuracy
- think of a schedule as a probability
- estimating things is hard, esp. if the team or the work is new
- good estimates come from good designs and good engineers: the work should be clear and the people doing the work should have a clear idea of how to carry it out 
- Useful question to ask: "What questions can I answer that would make you more confident about giving an estimate?"
- Estimates should have confidence levels / probabilities
- Estimates depend on how well folks know the overall goals of the project

Common oversights include:

- not taking into account sick days / holidays / vacations etc.
- not making sure you're tracking to the schedule on a regular basis
- the team not feeling committment to the schedule
- were the goals of the project => specs / design plans clear enough to enable accurate estimates of how long things would take?
- did folks on the team feel like they could say _no_ to work that did not address one of the goals of the project?

Snowball effect: If you miss your first deadline, the probability you miss your second deadline skyrockets

## making schedules work

- Milestone length should make project volatility
- be optimisitc in vision and skeptical in the schedule
- plan checkpoints where features can be add/cut according the changing needs or information
- understand the team's familiarity with the project space
- take on risks early


## interesting quotations that don't fit neatly into the above

> Project managers must be persuasive in getthing the team to strive for simplicity in the work they do, without minimizing the complexitites involved in writing good, reliable code

> Confusing processes with the goals is one of the great sins of management.

> Make good stuff happen
