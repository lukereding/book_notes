# risk saavy

Gigerenzer

A thought-provoking book. His thesis is very much _contra_ that of folks like Tversky and Kahneman; he argues that the so-called irrationally of aspects of human behavior are not wrong or suboptimal per se, but often exist for specific and 'adaptive' purpose. The single-best idea from this book around how to think about relative and absolute risks and 'natural frequencies,' i.e., the numbers out of a large sample (the difference between 0.1% and '1 in 1000').

- he advocates for using absolute instead of relative risks. there's a connection to a different book a read a long time ago on this, the idea being that doubling a tiny risk is still a tiny risk
- 'turkey illusion' mistaking uncertainty (things that can't be quantified or estimated) with risks (things that can, like a lottery). a lot of ideas I hear now are so poor because they fall victim to this illusion
- defensive decision-making - choosing a worse option for protection in case something goes wrong. but if the second-best option really remediates the risk, is the second-best option _really_ the second-best option?
- he argues that _models are only useful when dealign with risk; in an uncertain world, rules of thumb rule_. This is a very simple statement that contains a lot of wisdom.
- the importance of listening to intuition _when you have a lot of experience_ with what you're doing
- expected utility theory is the right way to make decisions only in a worls where you can reliabily estimate risks--not in an uncertain world. also assumes everything can be exchanged for some common currently (utility or money; Agüera y Arcas makes a similar point in the final chaper of his book)
