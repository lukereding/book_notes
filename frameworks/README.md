# frameworks

When I started managing teams, my time dried up. I also found that it was useful to have people be able to think I way I thunk, and make decisions like I did, so that I had time to work on other things.

So I started jotting down some frameworks on index cards I keep by my desk. These 'frameworks' are largely an extension of the various 'guides' I've developed in other parts of this repo.

The guides are useful, but they don't fit on an index card. And I'm older now and have a deeper understanding of things, so some words on an index card is all I really need.

These frameworks are really just little reminders for thinking tools to apply to help me navigate new situations. Different tools are better for some situations than others, so the frameworks are broken out by these situations.


## model risk

maybe the most powerful question: what's going on here?

- materiality vs likelihood (basically, the Hand rule)
- now vs. later
- model usage
- for what purpose?
- comprehensive is risk assessment, but slope effort
- quantify where you can
- size the risk
- segment
- state the validation and why it's appropriate
- performance / assessment on the margins / decision boundary
- precision vs. accuracy
- have hypotheses and sniff around
- monitor it 
- regulatory compliance
- ethics


## management

deliver value
- vision / strategy
- long-term delivery
- short-term delivery

manage up and across
- stakeholder heath
- managing up

team and org health
- morale
- associate growth
- team evolution
- org resilience
- delta method
- innovation


## project management

- roadmap
- milestones
- RACI
- dependencies
- risk register
- charter
- readouts / demos
- who are your stakeholders? influence vs. impact, engagement strategy
- personas
- how is everyone informed?
- process and QC
- change management
- metrics
- ceremonies
- compounding risks / the product rule


## product

- what does success look like?
- what problem are we solving?
- how could we not have this problem?
- what are the constraints and limitations? what some weren't present?
- what's the null expectation?
- understand the user's needs, not what they say they want

## problem-solving 

- are you solving the right problem
- break it down into little problems
- solve the opposite problem
- relax a contraint
- who else has solved it?
- solve a different problem
- add a contraint
- vanishing options test
- combine options: 'or' -> 'and'
- evaluation
	- effect in 5 days / weeks / years
	- second-order impact
	- premortem
	- what would you suggest a friend do?
	- what would have to be true for this to be the right answer?
	- can you do a test?
	- opportunity cost

## general thinking

- impact vs effort and other 2x2 boxers
- decision matrix
- premortem
- what happens next?
- work backwards
- null hypothses
- how do we not have this problem?
- solve the opposite

## life

- question your assumptions
- simplify
- be curious!
- be better
- think probabalistically
- listen
- intention is everything
- notice!
- be you
