## various notes from _thinking fast and slow_

> quick aside: I read this book prior to my senior year of college, and bits of it again during grad school, but I nevere wrote down notes or insights that struck me as significant. this document is an attempt to do just that. 

each bullet starts with a 'cX', where X is the chapter number this point is derived from.

-----------

- c1: kahneman argues that there are two 'systems' we use when making decisions or judgments: system i is fast and suseptible to bias, system ii smarter but we tend not to invoke it because thinking is hard

- c2: system ii is the system you use to do effortful comparsions or deliberate choices; if you jam your system ii by trying to remember specific words or counting the numbere of 'f's on a page, your ability to do anything that requires system ii does down. when system ii is busy, system i takes over

- c3: the concept of _flow_ is really intriguing. would be interested to read more into research around flow

- c3 -_ego depletion_ (stupid name): if you have to exert effort to do something / keep yourself from doing something (appear impressive; trying to respond in a restrained, appropriate way to a coworker), you are less likely to exert self-control in the future. curiously, can sometimes be prevented by drinking juice (glucose). implication: people at the end of long meetings, or at the end of the day, or before lunch, might be relying too much on system i, default to sop or bau or fail to really think through the problem.

- c3: system ii is hard, so if you're weak or tired, it takes over. the well-known case of the israli parole board is one example.

- c3: intelligence is not just about reasoning; it's about mashalling the relevant material in memory and deploy attention when needed. kahneman also builds up some examples illustrating a link between control and focus and intelligence 

- c4: the idea of _priming_. study of priming people with old-age-related words walking more slowly. implication: how could you prime people to behave like you want? what should you talk about at the start of a presentation? is it possible to prime yourself to reinforce positive behaviors? cna you prim creativity? 

- c4: setting can have priming effects. example: voters who voted in a school are more likely to vote for more school funding. 

- c4: priming people with money can have some bad effects. people are more individualistic and more selfish. implication: the prevalance of money in hip hop

- c4: the crazy study with the eyes over the coffee can (when there's a photo of eyes over can you put coffee money in--honor's system!--you pay more compared with photos of flowers, which is a bizarre control. i wonder about dog eyes or insect eyes or eeven th spots from a butterfly's wings)

- c5: how to write a persuasive message: basically, do whatever you con to avoid cognitive strain. maximize legebility (implications: fonts types and styles; prevalance of clean typefaces like helvetica and futura). use simple language. make your message memorable. make the font bigger--tiny font induces strain. if you use a color, make it red or blue, something with good contrast. implications: obvious implications for writing documents, giving presentations

- c5: "creativity is associative memory that works exceptionally well." This is probably a simplification but an interesting one. note: if you want to have fun playing around with this, try the [remote association test](https://www.remote-associates-test.com/).
