# difficult conversations

Difficult conversations are about different values, perceptions, and interpretations, not facts. The main point of the book is to be curious about the other person's point of view (think of the conversation as a learning conversation) and try to get to a holistic understand about the core issue that underlies the difficult issue.

They argue that difficult conversations have three parts to them. Decomposing the conversation into these parts can help you navigate the conversation better:

1. the what happened conversation
2. the feelings conversation
3. the identity conversation

## shift to a learning stance

### the what happened conversation

we tend to think we are right, the other person is wrong. or that they are the problem, not us. to move forward, you have to stop thinking like that. you need to be curious about the other person's point of view. the goal should be __to understand the other person__.

different people will see the world differently: we get different information, we filter / perceive that information differently, and that leads to different conclusions about the world.

you need to __be curious__ about what information or biases the other person is using to come to a conclusion that's different from yours. realize that both perspectives are valid and there is no correct way to view the situation. they advocate something they call _the and stance_ which basically just means that we are complex beings. we you're breaking up with someone, you don't need a single reason, it could be 'this is good for me _and_ i should have been clearer about my feelings earlier on _and_ ...'

### disentangle intent from impact

1. we typically assume we know the other person's intent, but __intentions are invisible__. we typically assume a person's intent based on the impact they have on us, but assuming we know the other person's intentions is super costly and often creates defensiveness which gets in the way of a learning conversation. 

2. we also assume that if we acted with good intentions, the other person's feelings are longer relevant. it's a mistake to clarify your intentions early on in a conversation; it generally encourages defensiveness and sends the signal that you're more interested in justifying your behavior than understanding the other person. 

To avoid mistake (1), disentangle intent from impact by asking yourself:

1. Action. What did the other person do?
2. Impact. What impact did this have on me?
3. Assumption. Based on this impact, but am I assuming about the other person?

You should share the impact, but not that your assumption is a guess: it can be overturned by talking to other person. 

To avoid mistake (2), reflect on your intentions and realize that they might not be as pure as you'd like to think.


### abandon blame

blaming someone else isn't constructive and in almost all cases it's simply wrong: both parties usually share parts of the blame. the goal should be to form a greater holistic understanding of the situation. blame prevents us from learning the greater system that contributed to problem at hand.

by embracing contribution spurning blame, it doesn't mean you only have to focus on your contribution, it doesn't mean you have to put aside your feelings, and it doesn't mean blaming the victim. 

some common, difficult-to-spot contributions:

1. letting a problem fester
2. being unapproachable
3. differences in background, preferences, communication style, etc.
4. problematic role assumptions

To force yourself away from blame, try:

- putting yourself in the other person's shoes
- imagining yourself as an impartial outside observer 


### have your feelings

feelings are often at the heart of difficult conversations. you have to be able to talk about your feelings to get to a place of understanding with the other person, as daunting as that can seem sometimes. unexpressed feelings can leak into the conversation, get in the way of you truly listening, or create so much tension that you disengage. 

tips for unearthing your feelings:

- explore your 'emotional footprint'--the types and intensity of the emotions we feel it's okay to express. note that we often put other people's feeling before our own (I am guilt of this a lot). learn to recognize your feelings are just as important as everyone elses.

- find the feelings behind simple labels. try to find more nuanced words to describe what you're feeling. instead of afraid, maybe you feel worried, obsessed, terrified, or suspicious. using more specific words can help you understand what you're really feeling.

- __find the feelings lurking under your assumptions and judgements__. think about the judgements or attributions we place on someone else. "you're inconsiderate", "you should have been there for me," "why do you want to hurt me": lurking under each of these are feelings you need to tease out.

don't let your feelings take over: you can't control your feelings or what you feel, but you can control your response and how you communicate them:

1. frame feelings back into the problem
2. express the full spectrum of your feelings
3. don't evaluate, just share your feelings. don't express those judgements or attributes. focus on the root cause: your feelings. an easy reminder is to use __"I feel..."__ more often

you have to __acknowledge the other person's feelings__. this means letting the other person know you heard them, that their feelings matter to you, and that you're working to understand them.

### ground your identity

difficult conversation often get to questions about who we are. the core identities:

- am i competent?
- am i a good person?
- am i worthy of love?

the main thing to realize is that life in complex and the answers above can rarely be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'. competence isn't all or nothing. but to navigate this conversation you need to:

1. become aware of your identity issues. 

2. integrate new information into your identity. realize that your identity is complex.

there are a few complexities that will help you get through the identity conversation:

- realize you will make mistakes
- realize your intentions are complex
- realize you have contributed to the problem

## create a learning conversation

### when to raise it and when to let it go

when deciding whether to raise something, walk through the three conversations yourself. there are some cases where raising difficult problems doesn't make sense:

- the real conflict is internal
- ask yourself whether there's a better way to address the issue than talking about it (e.g. by taking some action)
- do your purposes make sense? remember that you can't change other people. don't focus on short-term relief if it brings harm in the long-run. 

sometimes we simply have to let go. sometimes relationships just don't work or the other person isn't willing to engage. the best you can do it to try.

purposes that make sense for raising a difficult issue:

- to learn their story
- the express your views and feelings
- to problem-solve together

### starting the difficult conversation

typical openings don't help because we start from our perspective and the other person is immediately defensive. instead:

1. __start from the third story__: this is the story that an impartial outside observer would see. think like a mediator that's interested in understanding both sides of the story and everyone's perspective. if you don't know the other person's story, the opening can still go like "my sense is that we see this differently. i want to talk about how i see it and learn more about how you're seeing it." 

2. extend an invitation. describe your purposes. make them a partner in a learning conversation.

### listen from the inside out

basically you need to truly be interested in understanding their point of view, listening to them, and making sure that they understand that you recognize their feelings as valid. 

listen to the internal voice in your head that often gets in the way of actual listening. you can either channel that voice in learning mode and ask questions that can try to quiet the voice, or you may have to express your internal voice before you can truly listen to the other person.

three listening skills:

1. inquiry. don't make statement disguised as question. don't use questions to cross-examine. ask open-ended questions. ask for concrete information. ask questions to get at the three conversations. 

2. paraphrasing. this let's the other person know you're listening to them and makes sure you understand what they're expressing. 

3. acknowledgment. examples: "it sounds like you're really upset by this," "this seems important to you," "I'd feel confused if I were you, too"


### speak for yourself with clarity and power


to express yourself fully, you have to realize that what you want to say is worthy of expression. failure to express yourself keeps you out of the relationship [i am guilty of this]. we have to share what's important to us, otherwise we will damage our relationships. be explicit. don't assume the person can intuit what you're thinking or read your mind. 

three guidelines for telling your story:

1. don't present your conclusions are truth

2. share where your conclusions came from

3. don't exaggerate by using words like 'always' and 'never'

to help them understand you, ask the them to paraphrase back and ask how they see things differently (and why)

### problem-solving

reframing is powerful. take what the other person says and translate into the three conversations:

truth -> different stories
accusations -> intentions and impact
blame -> contribution
judgements, characterizations -> feelings 
what's wrong with you -> what's going on for them

you can't start to problem solve until the other person feels heard and understood.

### putting it all together

1. walk through the three conversations. 

ask yourself what your story is, what their story is. think about both party's intentions and impact. think about the contribution system.

figure out what you're feeling.

ask yourself how the situation threatens your identity.

2. check your purposes and decide whether to raise the issue

3. start from the third story

4. explore their story and your story

5. problem solve
