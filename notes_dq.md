# Delinquent: inside America's debt machine

Botella

A fascinating and illuminating book.

The core ideas of the book:

- Americans are lured into taking on more debt than that actually want / need to take on ("the principle argument")
- Americans overpay for the debt they take on ("the interest argument")

Notes below, but some core takeaways:

- revolvers will typically keep utilization constant when their line is increased. She makes the argument that banks basically determine how much they want to lend and increase credit lines to match that amount 
- revolving credit lines are inherently difficult for humans to reason about. an 'open' credit line and the resulting interest calculations are empirically difficult for people to reason about. Empirically, it's difficult for consumers to evaluate the cost of credit for a revolving credit line compared to an installment loan; it's telling that institutions like credit unions that offer cheaper rates than banks have much higher market share for installment loans (e.g., auto loans and mortgages). Partially as a result of this, people are generally insensitive to APR.
- the idea that rewards are essentially regressive: interchange fees raise the prices for _everyone_, but only those uses credit cards with rewards recouple that ~2% cash back (and even if they have a rewards card, revolvers typically don't benefit much since their purchase volume is constrained by their credit limit). Estimates are that reward cost poor people $21 a year; rich Americans make $750 on average from rewards
- The idea that the cost of funds doesn't trickle down to consumers (like the cost of gas does, or even the interest rate for your mortgage)
- The idea that capping interest rates would probably have the effect of excluding a lot of people from credit cards

- in many ways, the loan sharks or the early 20th century are less violent than the payday lenders of today, who can rely on civil judgement and low enforcement to enforce payment to lenders
- "Everyone who works for a living must grapple with the consequences of their work: Are the consequences of my work good, bad, neutral, or unknowable? If I didn't do my job, would someone else do it, and what would the consequences of that be? Is there anything I can do to make the consequences of my work better? Can a company itself be said to be good or bad? Can a good person work for a bad company? Does it matter what their role is, whether they are there to sweep the floors, flip burgers in the cafeteria, schedule meetings, enter data into spreadsheets, be a manager who makes the smallest decisions, or act as an executive who can make some bigger choices but is nevertheless bound by the imperatives of their corporate machine?"
- she cites some studies in the lab about raising the interest rate for a resolving loan from 18% to 42%; the same proportion of people take the loan under both conditions, presumably because people have trouble mapping interest rates to real borrowing costs
- a lot of what underlies the credit card calculus: availability of credit is inherently good
- there's a lot of really good info about the social and economic conditions that gave rise to a lot of the banking policy of today
  - civil rates in 60s, banking reform in the 70s to cut down on practices like red-lining and access to credit
  - in the 70s, credit was very cheap (for those who had access) and inflation was very high
  - early mass-market loans were installment loans, whose cost of credit was easy to calculate
  - first credit card, in the 50s, with diners club, a charge card, initially just for very wealthy people
  - courts allowed for loopholes that allowed banks to charge more interest, making it probably to extend lending to the middle class, then finally to the poorer classes, with risk-based pricing
- she also makes the point about all the tests financial institutions run on consumers, and how in academic settings those tests are fairly regulated and experiments are basically held accountable for the tests and possible impacts; the same isn't true for companies, especially financial institutions where the impacts of those experiments can be fairly serious
- "When you realize this -that most consumers who borrow money on their credit cards will use most of each extra batch of credit that banks extend to them (even if they wouldn't have otherwise applied for a new credit card or asked for a credit limit increase- an important implication emerges. The amount of credit card debt Americans carry isn't really driven by how much they want or need to borrow. Instead, it is driven by how much banks have chosen to lend"
- there are also some interesting conversations about 
  - wants vs needs, and how reasonable people can easily differ on what's a need vs a want. 'necessity' is very much shaped by expectations and class background
  - option sets and how consumers often end up in a bad spot because they constrain their choices and the options available to them 
- generally, when the economy is doing worse, credit card debt decreases; when it's booming, credit card debt is higher: often people turn to credit cards when they are optimistic about their prospects
- she compares CLIPs to opiods; they are inherently good or bad, they are necessary for some people, but they can also be heavily abused. they're powerful, effective, and hard to resist
- when shopping for credit cards, most people ignore the APR and focus on the rewards; even cards for subprime borrowers can often come for rewards
- she argues that credit line increases need to feature more heavily in conversations about debt and credit cards:
  - people who carry a balance will generally use more of the line if it's extended to them
  - similar borrowers who _aren't_ extended the line don't increase their outstandings
- the EU and Australia have caps on interchange fees; in the EU, it's 0.3%, compared to 2.25% in the US. The US has caps, but they only apply to debt cards, which is why debit cards often lack rewards
- risk-based pricing for credit cards is regressive: rich people pay less than poor people. on the other hand, if you look at common government loans (SBA disaster loans), they offer a single low interest rate, but they also turn away a lot of applicants (~60%) basically because of of their checkered credit history. So the lack of risk-based pricing can also have negative consequences, where the government is only confident enough in those with good credit histories to lend to
- In many EU countries, the bureaus only keep track of negative things that consumers do (e.g., missed payments). This means the absence of a credit history doesn't work against you, but also has drawbacks
- she argues that in a lot of cases, credit-building products (like a secured credit card) don't increase you're credit score as much as simply waiting for past behaviors to fall off your credit report, and increase the likelihood that you'll revolve on the card and get into more debt
- "I think I have reached some important answers about the nature of consumer debt in the twenty-first century. I don't feel like I have reached a satisfactory answer about how an American can earn a living and, simutaneously, feel at peace with the consequences of one's actions upon the world. We each have some degree of responsibility for the choices we make, but when we live in a system based on greed, opportunism, and exploitation, rather than a system rooted in solidarity and compassion, there are no easy answers for any given individual in isolation. I am sure more than a few people will read this book (or, at least, read a summary of this book) and conclude that I am an enormous hypocrite for having profited for five years from the system of exploitation described herein. And let me just say, those critiques are absolutely correct: I am, ethically, delinquent, too."
