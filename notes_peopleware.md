# notes on _peopleware_
DeMarco and Lister


- Your job is so longer tech-focused--tech is the easy problem
- Most projects fail for people and not technical reasons

### chapter 2

- Ensure that people know it's okay to make errors
- Know that people are different, have difference needs and motivations, and that's okay. Not everyone is going to fit into a mold
- Spending all your time _doing_ instead of brainstorming, reading, training, scheduling, etc. is anti-pattern

### chapter 3

- Beware the 'Spanish theory' of productivity

### chapter 4

- consumers / the market will tolerate low quality
- builders like higher quality
- sacrificing quality has secondary impacts you want to avoid
- japan shows that there ins't necessarily a tradeoff between productivity adn quality. high quality => cost reduction

### chapter 5

- Your workers probably don't follow Parkinson's Law in their work projects

### chapter 8

- Some rules of thumb:
  - the best workers are ~10x more productive than the worst workers
  - the best worked is still 2.5x the median performer
  - once you have some experience, experience is a poor predictor of performance, at least for SWE
- workers might be self-selecting / clustering past on performance, like assortative mating for performance, both within and across companies. implies there's a 10x performance difference between the most- and least-productive companies
- "You never get anything done around here between 9 and 5" is an antipattern
- Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that's better than not measuring it at all

### chapter 10
- coding, design, writing require flow
- it takes ~15 min to get into flow
- flow can be broken easily with interruptions 
- what matters is not the time you're present, but the amount of time you're working at your full potential
- e-factor = uninterrupted hours / "body present" hours

### chapter 12

- listening to music may inhibit your creativity, as both require the same brain regions

### chapter 13

- architecture of the workspace
- ideally, you want your workspace to mot be set up by some master plan, but instead adopt
  - piecemeal growth
  - shared design patterns
  - local control of the space
- think: modular, windows, outdoor space

## part III

The formula:
- Hire the right people
- Make them happy
- Turn them loose

### chapter 14

- "Managers are unlikely to change their people in any meaningful way"
- Corporate culture can implicitly push you towards hiring "average" or normal employees
- beware the term 'unprofessional' as a stand-in for 'not like us'

### chapter 15

- leadership as providing a catalyst, not directing
- connection between leadership and innovation
