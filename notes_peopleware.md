# notes on _peopleware_
DeMarco and Lister


- Your job is so longer tech-focused--tech is the easy problem
- Most projects fail for people and not technical reasons

### chapter 2

- Ensure that people know it's okay to make errors
- Know that people are different, have difference needs and motivations, and that's okay. Not everyone is going to fit into a mold
- Spending all your time _doing_ instead of brainstorming, reading, training, scheduling, etc. is anti-pattern

### chapter 3

- Beware the 'Spanish theory' of productivity

### chapter 4

- consumers / the market will tolerate low quality
- builders like higher quality
- sacrificing quality has secondary impacts you want to avoid
- japan shows that there ins't necessarily a tradeoff between productivity adn quality. high quality => cost reduction

### chapter 5

- Your workers probably don't follow Parkinson's Law in their work projects

### chapter 8

- Some rules of thumb:
  - the best workers are ~10x more productive than the worst workers
  - the best worked is still 2.5x the median performer
  - once you have some experience, experience is a poor predictor of performance, at least for SWE
- workers might be self-selecting / clustering past on performance, like assortative mating for performance, both within and across companies. implies there's a 10x performance difference between the most- and least-productive companies
- "You never get anything done around here between 9 and 5" is an antipattern
- "Anything you need to quantify can be measured in some way that is superior to not not measuring it at all"

### chapter 10
- coding, design, writing require flow
- it takes ~15 min to get into flow
- flow can be broken easily with interruptions 
- what matters is not the time you're present, but the amount of time you're working at your full potential
- e-factor = uninterrupted hours / "body present" hours

### chapter 12

- listening to music may inhibit your creativity, as both require the same brain regions

### chapter 13

- architecture of the workspace
- ideally, you want your workspace to mot be set up by some master plan, but instead adopt
  - piecemeal growth
  - shared design patterns
  - local control of the space
- think: modular, windows, outdoor space

## part III

The formula:
- Hire the right people
- Make them happy
- Turn them loose

### chapter 14

- "Managers are unlikely to change their people in any meaningful way"
- Corporate culture can implicitly push you towards hiring "average" or normal employees
- beware the term 'unprofessional' as a stand-in for 'not like us'

### chapter 15

- leadership as providing a catalyst, not directing
- connection between leadership and innovation

### chapter 19

- new employees are net negative
- companies with high turnover skew towards short-term thinking. often results in promoting the best people, which leads to a top-heavy org
- high turnover is a positive feedback loop (in a bad way)
- the best orgs all have a preoccupation with being the best - in other companies, it's never discussed
- companies with low turnover invest a lot in retraining, not because its economical but because it creates a strong culture of excellence and community

### chapter 21

- workers will not simply accept the org's goals as their own
- jelled teams are unstoppable
- often times reminding the team about some corporate goal disconnected from them can be demotivating
- teams help pull everyone in the same direction, even if very little teamwork is required in most work
- signs of jell:
  - money, status matter less
  - strong sense of identity
  - sense of eliteness
  - ownership
  - enjoyment in their work

### chapter 23

- to help teams jell:
  - put them together
  - trust them
  - assign folks to a single team
  - don't impose arbitrary deadlines


### chapter 26

the best managers provide frequent, easy opportunities for the team to succeed together. making a meal together example

### chapter 27

- open kimono - you trust and accept the work your people do. you let them be autonomous and make decisions differently than you would have made them
- it's still okay for managers to user their 'natural authority,' just not the authority that derives solely from their title

### chapter 28

elements of building chemistry:

- make a cult of quality
- provide closure
- provide a sense of eliteness
- encourage heterogenity
- protect successful teams
- provide strategic, not technical, direction

'quality' is a common theme in the book and how the market / managers /etc. don't really care about quality

> the essence of successful management is to get everyone pulling in the same direction

### chapter 29

beware Methodology dictated from on high - the project worker are in the best place to know what will and won't work

### chapter 30

- risk as an indicator of potential value
- the purpose of risk management is not to eliminate risk, but to engage sensible mitigations should those risks materialize 

### chapter 31

- technology enables meetings to be bad
- "defensive participation" - too many attendees because (a) there's never an agenda anyone sticks to and (b) it's possible that stuff relevant to a given project or person could come up in any meeting

### chapter 32

it can be a waste to staff up early on a project during the design phase, but often happens for political reasons

### chapter 33

- most email is spam
- most email is a sign of organizational dysfunction

> if you need to know everything in order to do anything you're not going to much anything done

### chapter 34 - making change

- people hate change
- most people that understand / benefit from the old system will be against you
- the response to change is emotional, not logical
- never demean the old way - celebrate it as a way to help change happen
- how change happens: old way -- foreign element --> chaos -- transforming idea --> practice --> new way

### chapter 35

organizational learning is constrained by turnover

### chapter 36

disorder / chaos can be fun / require problem-solving. examples for introducing chaos:
- brainstorm
- pilot projects
- retreats / celebrations
