I have mixed feelings about this book. There's a lot of very useful and practice advise in here. A lot of it is stuff I've learned in the last ~5 years by doing and observing, so this book would have been welcome earlier on in my career. On the other hand, some of the prescriptions don't ring true and feel too formulaic. In places, there was very little depth. For example, there's a chapter on telling stories that's just a few pages long, and doesn't explain narrative arcs or what makes a story a story.

The content also ranges widely, from giving toasts to revising emails and giving feedback to where to put your hands when speaking. It's probably good to use as a reference if you feel stuck whenever you need to communicate something.

What follows are notes on the parts of the book that felt the freshest and most interesting to me.

--------

#### core point of the book

__Communicating is less about you you trying to say something and more about you giving the other person / people what they need to effect some action__. Over and over, the author asks us to revise our approach to communication considering the perspective of the person we're communicating _to_


#### open-ended questions

There's a good section in the book on asking questions, particularly to unearth 'unknown unknowns'. Good open-ended questions can help with that. This dovetails with a lot of the broader stuff I've been reading about coaching that advises using open-ended questions to guide help people problem-solve for themselves. In this case, however, open-ended questions are used to make sure that al major issues are surfaced as early as possible (connection _risk upfront_).

| Closed                             | Open                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Did you finish the memo?           | Where are you with the memo?                |
| Do you need help with X?           | How can I help you with X?                  |
| Have you tried X in that analysis? | What would the benefit of trying X here be? |

Answers to closed questions often take the form of 'yes' or 'no'.

Some good open-ended questions:
- how can i help?
- what would be most helpful to you? (this is similar to rifat's 'what do you need from me?')
- less open-ended: would it be helpful to you if I…?

#### writing tips

There's a section on the book focused on writing, but I honestly found it to be less useful that the other sections.

The main points:

- eliminate unnecessary words
- rationalize your verbs. Make sure they're strong
- shorten sentences
- eliminate jargon where appropriate
- replace passive where active, unless you want to soften the blow / evade responsibility 

In writing, ask:

- why is the reader reading this?
- what does the reader need to do with this info?
- **how can i make it effortless for the reader to get to the main message?**

I think we generally fail to ask these questions, especially the last one. We're generally too preoccupied with checking whether what we're saying is clear to us.

#### on persuading

This is one of the examples that feels too formulaic and simplify to be helpful, but in case not:

- state the main message. give the answer up front (present)
- give background (past)
- expand the message (future). describe the future impact and benefits
- end quickly (future). include next steps

#### effective client meetings

This was an interesting chapter, and while it was focused on client meetings, I think it's useful from a general 'stakeholder management' perspective as well:

- before the meeting
  - understand your style
    - if you're the sort of person who takes a data dump on their audience, recognize that, and think about how you're going to counter that impulse
    - if you're the sort of person who just relies on slides, think about what you'll do if the conversation veers off-script
  - adopt the right frame of mind
    - the goal with these sorts of meeting __is for you to learn__
    - the goal is not to get through your slides or communicate some recommendation you have
    - the goal is always to understand more about your client / customer
- during the meeting
  - set the tone
  - confirm the purpose of the meeting
    - sounds obvious, but sometimes people are super busy and sort of forget where they are and why they're in the meeting
  - gather current information
    - this was one of the most interesting parts of the book to me. once you've confirmed the purpose of the meeting, **ask, "Before we get started...[insert open-ended question here]?"**
    - E.g., "Before we get started, what's really keeping you up at night?" or "Before we dive in, any major sources of concern with the proposal?"
    - This might lead to a conversation that derails what you wanted to talk about, but it if leads to _you understanding the client better_, then it was a good use of time
    - Ask this also makes it clear to the other person that you're there to solve their problems and you're genuinely interested in what they have to say
  - discuss what you have to say
  - talk about benefit to the client
  - establish next steps
    - if you've scribbled nouns during the meeting, make sure before you close out the meeting you have verbs next to each noun, and someone assigned to each noun / verb combination 


#### delegation

This was a really interesting part of the book.

When delegating, you still need to focus more on the other person and less on yourself. Delegation is not about what you want: it's about what the other person needs in order to give you what you want.

- show them the big picture and where this work fits into the big picture
- outline the assignment and set expectations. make it clear what's expected and when the work is expected to be done by
- explain the roles of other people on the team
- explain the reasons for selecting this person for the job, especially the benefits to him / her
- explain the next steps
- summarize what you want the person to do
  
Throughout all of this, emphasize the benefit to the person and convey the message that you care about their development and you care that they do a good job

#### leadership

Chapter 15 presents a pretty interesting and useful model for thinking about leadership.

**Your values.** This is what you stand for. Again, make it less about 'I' and more about the impact / effect on others. If you stand for 'integrity', you might communicate that as you deserve someone you can trust'. for 'i want to make the world a better place': 'you children deserve a more just society.' Think politicians: they generally show their values in similar terms

**Your vision.** This is the future you want to bring about. 

**Your plan.** Basically, strategy. How we're going to get from here to there.

Think about the 'why' from the perspective of who you’re talking to. Depending on your audience, the 'why' might sound different.

When inspiring people, use stories (e.g., burn the ships, cross the canyon). Stories ground more nebulous ideas in reality

**Your actions**. You model the behavior you expect. If you're actions don't match your words, you will not be credible
