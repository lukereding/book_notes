# Design as art 

Munari

Munari is a thoughtful, expressive, and expansive thinker. Though this book meandered and was more of a ragged array of assays and thoughts than anything else, there were tons of interesting thoughts and plums. The notes here are less notes and more 'things I found amusing while reading the book'.


A lot of his writing in the first part of the book is about _visual coherence_, i.e., designs should design things that have components that _work together well_ and _hold together as a visual unit well_. He also has a very democratic view of art of art and design: he believed it should be for everyone and woven into the fabric our our existence :

> there should be no such thing as art divorced from life, with beautiful things the look at and hideous things to use 

This quotation reminds me of another--I'm not sure who said it--to the affect of: 'bad design is worse than stealing. When someone steals, they are redistributing wealth and it affects only one person; bad design impacts everyone negatively.'

There is something very idealist and urgent in Muari's language is his _design as art_ essay that I find very invigorating.

> Anyone who uses a properly designed object feels the presence of an artist who has worked for _him_, bettering his living conditions and encouraging him to develop his taste and sense of beauty. 

> an artist is useful to society because he helps society recover its balance, and not to lurch btween a false world to live one's material life and an ideal world to take moral refuge in. When the objects we use every day and the surrounds we live in have becomes themselves a work of art, then we shall be able to say that we have achieved a balanced life.

Another interesting aspect of Munari is the way in which he seeks to destroy the boundaries between art and design and the relationship he draws between design and planning (I'd call it _engineering_).

The title of one essay asks, "What is a designer?" The answer comes in the first line: "He is a planner with an aesthetic sense," which reminds like a computer being a 'clock with benefits'. 

> Today we do not think in terms of beauty but but of formal coherence...A leaf is beautiful not because it is stylish but because it is natural, created in its exact form by its exact function. A designer tries to make an object as naturally as a tree puts forth a leaf.

> What then is this thing called Design if it is neither sale not applied art? It is planning: the planning as objectively as possible of everything that does to make up the surroundings and atmosphere in which men live today.

This, I think, as a lot in common with the core moral thrust of _the design of everyday things_, in which (I think it was that book) Norman talks about everything artificial as being designed. When you internal that you realize just have prevalent design is, whether we think about it or not.

Again, Munari brings up _coherence_ as the criteria we should use to judge an object:

> It is therefore a question of coherence.

> A designer with a personal style, arrived at _a priori_, is a contradiction in terms.

He has some interesting thoughts about graphic design and posters in particular the remind me of Maynard Smith's efficacy and strategic costs in animal signaling. In particular, he thinks that the borders of posters are ripe for play and manipulation, as they delicate the poster from its surroundings.

Munari has a bit of a diatribe about children's books that interesting from a product perspective. He talks about how children's books are _worse_ because publishers aim to please the customer (i.e., mom or dad) and not the customer (i.e., the child) and that children's books would be much better if authors were allowed to cater to the child directly.

Munari has some really interesting and (I think) still very modern views on living, views that I don't think the times have caught up to yet, and this fact probably speaks volumes about our society.

> The private house of the future (some are already lived in) will be as compact and comfortable as possible, easy to run and easy to keep clean without the trouble and expense of servants.

Well, the last part is true by necessity in most cases, but thinking about increasing functional comfort (as opposed to what I'd call _perceived_ comfort) as the objective function for housing is something that I think is still very fresh, at least in the American ethos, which continues to be dominated by suburbs, large houses, lawns that require more care than pets, cars that require special maintenance. This is probably less the case than it used to be with more people moving to cities, but I still think that few think about the success of their home as a function of practicality, ease of upkeep, and compactness. 

>  Subtract rather than add: this rule must be understood in the sense of reaching simplicity, getting at the essence of the object by eliminating anything superfluous until no further simplification is possible...By designing without any stylistic or formal preconceived notions, and tending towards the natural formation of things, one gets at the essence of a product.

The idea embodied by this quotation is something I feel to be painfully true, and yet I'm always surprised by the willingness and alacrity with with _adding_ unnecessary stuff is adopted by most people. Also reminds me of a Georgia O'Keefe quotation.

Part of what I love about this book is Munari's imagination really shines through. He is a committed generalist and this enables him to probe his world for all sorts of interesting connections. In one essay, he treats an orange, a pea, and a rose as he would manmade objects and evaluates them using the same criteria he would use to evaluation any other manmade object.

There's a fascinating essay called growth and explosion where he draws parallels between the growth of trees and plants as a sort of explosion writ very, very slow from a seed 'bomb', which makes you think about all sorts of other connections we're missing because processes occur on such different time scales.

The essay _continuous structures_ is fascinating from the perspective of someone interested in pattern, recursion, nature, and form. 

> The greatest freedom comes from the greatest strictness. - Paul ValÃ©ry

> In nature nothing is still.

> The principle of the form is not _it is_ but _one does_. - Bauhaus

> To understand means to be capable of doing. - Goethe

Another thing that this book drives home is how much you can do with so little. A ton of Munari's inventions or ideas in this book use very common, simple objects, he just relies on his creativity to expand and enliven them. There's an essay just about squares where he talks about all the design possibilities of that simplest of shapes; by the end of the essay, all I could think about what the diversity of all I had seen on the previous pages and how it's genesis was a such a common, simple shape.

Fascinating exercise: view objects around you as the physical remains of some long forgotten object and reconstruct the imaginary object, as a paleontologist reconstructs a dinosaur from bone fragments and other clues he finds.

> God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere.

Two final comments. Munari talks about design assignments as a series of _problems_; I think we should reframe questions or assignments as problems more generally. Second, based on the book, it seems like his brain works by seeing something and trying to relate it back to something unrelated he cares about. This connection-building apparatus that is his brain ensures the book remains fresh and vivid in a way that few books from this period could have remained.
