# Invisible women

Perez

There's a lot in this book, and these notes won't do them justice, but are some key things I took away.

The main themes:

- It's possible to know whether a given policy / practice is harmful to women if we don't look at data by sex
- In cases where sex-disaggregated data exists, it's clear that seemingly neutral policies that don't take into account sex or gender clearly have sex-specific impacts (e.g. the tax code)
- The female body is different from a man's body in a number of ways, but we tend to view the female as 'atypical' and the male body as standard or normal


Other notes:

- Even polices that seem really neural can be more harmful to women than men. E.g., radial grids in cities meant for male commutes to and from the suburbs, not the sort of 'trip-chaining' that most women do. E.g., snowplow removal cleared street first, but sidewalks are more likely to be used by women, and far more women than men were impacted by this policy
- Safety to chemical exposure in the workplace tends to be (a) focused on the impact in men, not women, and (b) acute exposure instead of the chronic exposure that many women face (think nail saloons)
- The crappiness of the gig economy tends to impact women more than man
- Bias in training datasets can have huge impacts and amplify / perpetuate harmful biases
- Car safety tests are based on typical male-sized and proportioned crash dummies - where female dummies are used they are simply scaled-down male dummies and are performed in the passenger, not the driver, seat
- Smartphone size and hand size
- Women do a _ton_ of unpaid labor in the form of eldercare and childcare; these typically are overlooked, not factored into GDP, etc.
- Drugs are often not tested in a sex-specific way, yet the cases where they have been often show sex-specific effects (e.g., helpful in women but not in men), yet drig tests typically only test with males to control for sex
