# originals: how non-conformists move the world

## various things I highlighted

- The hallmark of originality is rejecting the default and exploring whether a better option exists.
- Be curious.
- To be original, you need to take risks. By definition, no one has done what you're doing before. But these don't need to be over-the-top risks. Most originals diversify: they take on risks in one part of their life while being conservative in other areas of their lives. Entreprenuers that kept their day jobs had a 33% lower odds of failure than those that quit their day jobs. One interpretation is that in our to take bold, calculated risks, you need something to fall back on. Having security in part of your life means that you're free to take risks in another part of your life.
- If you want to be creative, generate a lot of different ideas. Then cull them down to the best ones.
- Read and think broadly. Pick up a new hobby or craft and make connections between the craft and what you want to be creative on. Nobel Laurettes are more likely to have some hobby or craft that they do on the side.
- Intuitions are only reliable when we have a lot of experience. When we don't have experience, we're more accurate when we take longer to think about something. The converse is true when we have a lot of experience.
- Involve peers in evaluating ideas. They have a more removed sense of what's good or not.
- To evaluate how good an idea to some problem is, try coming up with ideas/solutions to the ideal yourself beforehand. 
- 'The Sarick effect': tell people why you might be wrong upfront when selling them on some new idea. This humanizes you, makes you seem smarter and more trustworthy, and lets them be productive right away by suggesting things you can do to overcome your current challenges.
- Procrastination might improve novelty by giving your mind more time to muse over ideas.
- Whether an idea is a success or failure is largely tied to its timing.
- 'First mover advantage' is a myth. You typically want a market proven before you move in.
- to inpsire people, start with _why_. Communicating the _why_ behind our ideas is powerful and motivating.
- To expose gaps in your knowledge, ask yourself _how_ something works. For example, go through all the steps yourself to realize the links you don't totally understand.
- If your idea is very original, you might want to explain it by linking it to something familiar.
- Our best allies are the people that started against us then came around to our side.
- The most promising ideas begin from novelety then add familiarity.
- Firstborns tend to be more risk-averse than laterborns.
- "Committement" blueprints for startups [focus on cultural fit and diversity of ideas] led to companies with lower failure rates and higher IPOs.
- Minority views are important become they stimulate divergent thought and attention, even if they aren't adopted.
- Cures for groupthink: apoint a devil's advocate, or (better), get the people that think differently to speak up.
- When neverous, think "I am exicted" instead. Channel all that nervous energy into something positive.
- To modify behavior: If the behavior is perceived as safe, we should emphasize the good things that happen if someone does the behavior. If it's perceived as risky, emphasize what happens if they _don't_ do the behavior.
- Good practice for businesses: at a meeting, brainstorm all the ways the business could fail. Then safeguard against the top ideas.
- When committement to something is wavering, think of all the progress you've already made.
- Venting doesn't make you less angry.

## main takeaways

### individual actions

- question the defaults
- generate a _lot_ of ideas
- cross-train your mind by immersing yourself in a new domain
- procrastinate strategically; give your mind time to mull over the problem
- get feedback from peers

### voicing ideas

- if you take a risk in one area, stay conservative in another area
- highlight the reasons your idea is crap
- make your ideas familiar

### managing emotions

- don't try to calm down: convert nervous energy into excitement
- focus on the vectim, not the perpetrator

### creating new ideas

- supply channels for feedback / new ideas
- create a sense of urgency (e.g. what could kill our company in the next year?)
- draw ideas from diverse employees

### parent / teacher actions

- ask children what their role models would do
- link good behaviors to innate moral characters (e.g. "You're such a good person, thanks for doing X" instead of "Good job doing X"). Make them think the behavior is part of their character
- explain how bad behaviors hurt others / have consequences for others
- emphasizes values over rules -- explain why a good behavior is good and why a bad behavior is bad
