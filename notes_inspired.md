Overall, I liked this book a lot. There were a bunch of gems, which I try to capture below, albeit in an unstructured way.

### part 1

- it doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they aren't given something worthwhile to build
- root causes of failed product efforts
  - every company has a different vetting process for ideas, but ultimately boils down to (1) how much money will this make and (2) how much effort / time / money will it cost?
  - waterfall process is the cause of many failures
  - sales and stakeholders are not the best source of product ideas
  - at least half of your ideas aren't going to work
  - it typically takes several iterations to get the implementation of the idea to the point where it delivers necessary business value
  - engineers are often an untapped source of innovation
  - in the waterfall process, customer validation happens way too late
- three principle of truly agile teams
  - risks are tackled up front, not at the end
    - value risk, viability risk, feasibility risk, business viability risk
  - products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially
  - **it's all about solving problems, not implementing features**
- prototypes are important -- they require at least an order of magnitude less time and money than building a product
- the MVP should be a prototype, not a product

### part 3

- focus on **outcomes**, not **output**
- good product teams are good at iterating to an effective solution
- problem with roadmaps: they are interpreted as a commitment, but you need to learn / iterate / experiment to solve the problem
- instead of roadmaps: (1) product strategy / vision and (2) the business objections that the product is trying to drive
- teams should be aligned to a _business problem to solve_ instead of a feature or project that make or may not solve the underlying problem
- the product visions describes the future we're trying to create, perhaps 2-5 years out 
  - when well done, it's an effective recruiting and motivating tool
- the product strategy is a sequence of products / releases we plan to deliver on to get to the future defined by the vision 
- a vision inspires and sets the direction, while the strategy tells us how to get there
- principles of product vision
  - start with _why_. you need to clearly articulate the purpose: everything flows from that
  - fall in love with the problem, not the solution
  - think big
  - the vision needs to inspire
  - skate to where the puck is heading, not where it was
  - **be subborn on the vision but flexible on the details**
  - if you can truly validate a vision, it probably wasn't valuable enough
- principles of product strategy
  - focus on one target market / persona at a time
  - obsess over customers, not competitors
  - communicate the strategy widely
- product principles
  - the principles speak to the nature of the products we want to create
- product evangelism
  - use a prototype
  - show the team the customer pain you are addressing
  - share the vision
  - share learnings
  - share credit
  - gives great demos
  - be excited!


### part 4

- principles of product discovery
  - goal is to address these risks:
    - viability risk: will customer buy this or choose to use it?
    - usability risk: can the customer figure out how to use it?
    - feasibility risk: can we build it?
    - business viability risk: does this solution work for our business?
  - **we can't count on customers to tell us what to build: customers don't know what's possible**. it's our job to make sure we solve the underlying problem
  - delivering value is the core thing, even if customers have to wade through performance or usability issues at first
  - one of biggest traps in product: believing that we can anticipate our customer's reactions to our products
- opportunity assessment 
  - objective: what business objective does this work address?
  - key results: how will you know if you've succeeded?
  - customer problem: what problem will solve this for our customers?
  - target market: what type of customer are we focused on?


The rest of the book outlines some method for product discovery and testing usability that I haven't outlined here.
