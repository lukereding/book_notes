## notes on __culture code__

- "But individual skills are not what matters. What matters is the interaction."

- three main skills:
  - build safety
  - share vulnerability
  - establish purpose

### build safety

- Belonging cues create safe connection in groups. Examples are proximity, eye contact, body language, turn-taking, mimicry.

- Three qualities of belong cues:
  - energy
  - individualization
  - future orientation

- In order to build psychological safety, we need to constantly reinforce one another with belonging cues. Belonging needs to be reinforced constantly.

- Some study shows that team performance is driven by five factors:
  - everyone in the group talks and listens in equal measure
  - high leveels of eye contact
  - team members communicate with each other, not just the team lead
  - back-channel and side conversations exist
  - members sometimes go outside the team and bring back external information

- Anecdote about Google AdWords; Google culture, belonging cues, no one worrying about status or who was in charge

- Belonging cues don't have to do with character or disipline but answering the questions
  - are we safe
  - are we connected
  - do we share a future

- Successful cultures aren't necessarry happy, but they're engaged and energized. More oriented towards solving hard problems.

- Popovich as coach. His approach as (a) I care about you, (b) we have high standards, and (c) we arer connected in bigger ways than basketball

- Hsieh, Zappos, and 'collisions'. 

- Allen's studies of enginerring firms tackling the same problems, trying to understand which ones were successful. Success teams had clusters of high communicators. Success teams tended to sit closer to together and have more frequent interactions (the '[Allen curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve)').
