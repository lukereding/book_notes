## notes on __culture code__

Overall, I found the structure of this book confusing. At times the author interpreted phenomena through his 'culture' lens to to point of absurdity (e.g. the team that won the competition for the balloons as expanding their 'vulnerability networks'). There was lots of interesting food for thought in the book. But I got whiplash from visiting so many 'cultures', looking at them through a single prism, then moving on, sometimes to move _back_ to the same culture at another point in the book. Anyway, I came away with some interesting examples I'll remember but no cohesive framework for thinking about how or why some teams work better than others besides the three organizing parts of the book. The most practical part of the book, the ideas for action at the end of each part, where useful, but sometimes introduced new concepts or ideas to the reader, which left me flipping back pages thinking "Did I miss something?"

- "But individual skills are not what matters. What matters is the interaction."

- three main skills:
  - build safety
  - share vulnerability
  - establish purpose

### build safety

- Belonging cues create safe connection in groups. Examples are proximity, eye contact, body language, turn-taking, mimicry.

- Three qualities of belong cues:
  - energy
  - individualization
  - future orientation

- In order to build psychological safety, we need to constantly reinforce one another with belonging cues. Belonging needs to be reinforced constantly.

- Some study shows that team performance is driven by five factors:
  - everyone in the group talks and listens in equal measure
  - high leveels of eye contact
  - team members communicate with each other, not just the team lead
  - back-channel and side conversations exist
  - members sometimes go outside the team and bring back external information

- Anecdote about Google AdWords; Google culture, belonging cues, no one worrying about status or who was in charge

- Belonging cues don't have to do with character or disipline but answering the questions
  - are we safe
  - are we connected
  - do we share a future

- Successful cultures aren't necessarily happy, but they're engaged and energized. More oriented towards solving hard problems.

- Popovich as coach. His approach as (a) I care about you, (b) we have high standards, and (c) we arer connected in bigger ways than basketball

- Hsieh, Zappos, and 'collisions'. 

- Allen's studies of enginerring firms tackling the same problems, trying to understand which ones were successful. Success teams had clusters of high communicators. Success teams tended to sit closer to together and have more frequent interactions (the '[Allen curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_curve)').

#### ideas for action

- overcommunicate your listening. avoid interuptions.

- spotlight your fallibility early on, esp. if your the leader

- embrace the messanger 

- preview future connection

- overdo thank-yous

- hire well

- get rid of bad apples

- create places where people interact with each a lot

- make sure everyone has a voice

- avoid the feedback 'crap sandwich'


### share vulnerability

- Pixar, BrainTrust that identifies flaws and issues with movies as they're being made. Compare with the Navy SEALs AAR (After-Action Review). (Also compare to the advice from _radical candor_: to keep winning, criticize the wins.)

- Vulnerability is about sending a signal of a weakness and that you can use help

- Kauffman and SEAL training. All aspects of training are team-based. No distinction between the officers and enlisted men. Log PT creates intense vulnerability and deep interconnectedness. 

- Nyquist at Bells Labs. Productive people with lots of patents tended to eat lunch with him. He was warm (made you feel like he cared about you) and was insatiably curious. 

#### ideas for action

- Make sure the leader is vulnerable first and often. Laszlo Bock recommends leaders ask their people three questions: (1) What's one thing I'm currently do I should keep doing? (2) What's one think I don't do frequently enough that I should do more often? (3) What can I do to make you more effective? The key is to ask people for a single thing, not five or ten.

- Overcommunicate expectations.

- Deliver negative stuff in person.

- When forming new groups, pay attention to (a) the first vulnerability and (b) the first disagreement 

- Listen. The most effective listeners (1) interact in a way that makes the other person feel safe and supported, (2) take a helping stance, (3) occasionally ask questions, and (4) make suggestions to open up alternative paths. When you ask a question, you normally don't get a straight answer, you get a response, so you need to find ways to pull out the answer from the other person.

- In conversation, avoid the temptation to reflexively add value. Skilled listeners don't interrupt with new ideas or how an the experience relates to them.

- Use AARs or something similar. Should focus on the questions: (1) What did we want to do? (2) What happened? (3) What caused the results we got? (4) What would we do the same? (5) What would we do differently? In the BrainTrust at Pixar, the team isn't allowed to suggest solutions, only to identify problems.

- Aim for candor.

- Separate performance development and professional development. 

- Make the leader disappear occasionally.

### establish purpose

- Answers: What's all this for? What are we here for?

- "mental constrasting" - imagine a goal and envision the obstacles. Doing this results in higher success in achieving the goal than not doing it.

- Successful teams of doctors learning a new procedure (1) were told about how each person's skills were important for the overall team's success, (2) practiced, a lot, (3) were encouraged to speak up if they saw an issue, (4) discussed what went right and what went wrong

- High-purpose environments work by sharing a series of steady, clear signals that are aligned with the shared goal

- Important to distinguish between _high-proficiency environments_ that create consistency and _high-creativity environments_ for innovation. 

#### ideas for action

- Name and rank your priorities

- Be ten times as clear about your priorities as you think you should be. That is, overcommunicate the priorities.

- Figure out where your team ains for consistency and where it aims for creativity. 

- Measure what matters.

- Focus on bar-setting behaviors.
