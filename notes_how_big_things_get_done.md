# how big things get done

Flyvbjerg and Gardner

This was a great book that resonated with me on several levels and bolstered a lot of ideas I already find to be true.


core themes:

- the importance of experimentation, even for large, one-off projects
- recognize you know less than you think: unearth the unknown unknowns 
- cost overruns are typically fat-tailed distributions: if you're over-budget, you're likely to be over by _a lot_
- the importance of understanding the problem before solutioning
- the importance of base rates when estimating how long something will take

notes:

- think fast, act slow / make haste slowly. the idea that people tend to have a bias towards action, which can be good, but not if you don't fully understand the problem
- the "commitment fallacy" - people tend to lock into an idea early on before they understand the problem. this is almost always premature and causes problems
  - example of architect asking a lot of questions about the goal of the project before jumping into things. you aren't remodeling your kitchen: go a step deeper. do you want to enjoy more time with your family? entertain your friends more? spend more time preparing meals for your family?
- "think from right to left." basically, "start with the end in mind" or "work backwards" from where you want to be. forces you to "fill in the box at the right" (the goal). think carefully about other alternatives that could solve the goal, not just what came to mind first
- "pixar planning". the idea of iteration with increasing confidence. pixar starts with a rough story, revise, eventually add storyboards and sound, screen it to reviewers. they do this maybe 6-8 times for a given movie. it's a huge effort, but not compared to making the final movie and having the final movie be bad. Frank Gehry and his _in silico_ or stick and cardboard models, iterating a ton with increasing realism as the idea becomes more firm
- are you experienced? doing some new is risky, and there are few substitutes for someone who understands the problem space well
- do you think your project is unique?
  - this chapter is really about how forecasting goes wrong. we tend to think from the bottom up when forecasting: this is the scope of what I'm trying to do, I'll estimate all the pieces, add some buffer, and that's my final estimate
  - this method of forecasting is very poor compared to using base rates of similar projects and making small adjustments to the base rate
  - e.g. if renovating a kitchen, use data from kitchen renovations; if your revo. is especially complex or unique, adjust from the base rate
  - see our project as a member of a broader class of projects instead of a snowflake
  - in a lot of cases, your project will still have additional risks. if you think high cost overruns could still be an issue, then use classic risk mitigration: identify your core risks, and for the material / likely ones, develop risk mitigation measures
- modularity
  - there's a pretty interesting chapter at the end about modularity and modular projects. the idea being
    - most large projects can be decomposed into a collection of smaller, similar units. for example, a wind farm is a collection of wind turbines. wind turbines are a collection of a few core parts (the blades, etc.).
    - if you think about your project this way, it allows you to start small, see what works, apply those learnings to the next thing you do, adn continue. you learn as you go
    - it also allows for flexibility. if you think carefully about your interfaces, you can design things that scale up or down easy by adding or removing more individual components (think of cloud computing, or adding more turbines to a wind farm)


other notes and things I found interesting:

- most initial budgets are just to sell the project: they correspond in no way to any analysis. "the initial budget is the down payment". there are political reasons why this is the way it is, but it means that large public works projects will almost always be overbudget 
- the importance of asking questions at the start of the project. we typically start with an answer and move straight to execution without asking what probably we’re trying to solve. 
- "thinking from right to left" is more about thinking carefully about what problem you’re trying to solve and working backwards from that. most people start with a solution and move straight to execution
- "a good plan is one that meticulously applies experimentation or experience. a great plan is one that rigorously applies both."
- illusion of explanatory depth - people feel like they understand complex phenomena with greater precision, coherence, and depth than they really do
- the idea that cost and time overruns are not normally distributed; they are often distributed like a power law with long and potentially fat tails. overbudget probably doesn't mean "by 15%," it could mean by 100% or 800%. the degree of fat-tailness varies by the type of project; bigger, more 'unique' projects tend to have fatted tails than more modular projects like solar or wind
