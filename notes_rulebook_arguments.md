# A rulebook for arguments

Weston

### composing a short argument

- Distinguish premises (aka assumptions) from conclusion
- Present your ideas in a natural order
- Start from reliable premises. If our assumptions are shaky, your argument rests on shaky ground
- Be concrete and precise. Don't talk in generalities or use nebulous wording. Say what you mean.
- Avoid loaded language
- Use consistent terms. Don't change up the language or hit the thesaurus just to try and keep your writing fresh.
- Stick to one meaning for each term

### arguments by example

- give more than one example. If you're using induction, use several relevant examples to make your point\
- use representative examples. Lack of poor representativeness in your sample is often the cause of poor or specious arguments. Beware the 'person who' argument
- background information is crucial 
- consider counterexamples. try to understand if you can anticipate counterexamples that might be used to combat a premise, and try to understand whether it could be possible to turn a counterexample into an example

### arguments by analogy

- arguments by analogy require a relatively similar example. If the examples are too different or if there are meaningful differences, the argument is weak

### arguments from authority

- cite your sources
- use informed sources. don't cite a PhD in economics for a question about the efficacy of vaccines
- use impartial sources
- cross-check sources
- personal attacks do not qualify as a source

### arguments about causes

- explain how cause leads to effect. it's not enough to give a hypothesis: give reasons, too. make it credible
- propose the most likely cause
- correlated events are not necessarily related
- correlated events may have a common underlying cause
- either of the correlated events could cause the other
- causes are usually complex


### deductive arguments

- modus ponens: p -> q. p. ∴ q
- modus tollens: p -> q. ¬q. ∴ ¬p
- hypothetical syllogism. p -> q. q -> r. ∴ p -> r
- disjunctive syllogism. p or q. ¬p. ∴ q. works regardless of whether 'or' is meant 'either p or q but not both' or 'p or q, or possibly both'
- dilemma. p or q. p -> r. q -> s. ∴ r or s
- reductio ad absurdum. assume ¬p. argue from ¬p we'd have to conclude q. show that q is false. ∴ p. Really just modus ponens.


## composing an argumentative essay

### exploring the issue

- explore all sides of the issue. actually be curious! if you're coming in with a bias, it's your duty to explore the other side of the issue and find the true in it
- question and defend each argument's premises
- revise and rethink arguments as they emerge. you might find that your initial thinking was faulty as you go through this process--that's great!

### main points of the essay

- explain the question. why is it important? what depends on the answer? what problem are you solving for?
- make a definite claim or proposal
- develop your arguments fully
- consider objections. anticipate questions. proposals generally have many effects, apart from the intended one: what are these? are they acceptable, or can you mitigate the risks?
- consider alternatives. 

### writing

- follow your outline
- keep the intro brief
- give your arguments one at a time
- clarify!
- support objections with arguments
- don't claim more that what you've shown


## common fallacies

- Not using a representative sample, or a big enough sample, to support your premises
- Defining the alternatives too narrowly (i.e., black and white thinking)
- affirming the consequent: p -> q. q. ∴ p. Not valid.
- denying the antecedent. p -> q. ¬p. ∴ ¬q. Not valid.
