# The cognitive style of powerpoint
Tufte


What I love most about this pamphlet is the intentionality that seeps from every page. Tutfe isn't afraid to look very carefully, to take measurements to facilitate comparisons, to deconstruct a slide and question the importance and clarity of every element. I get invigorated reading these passages.

My main critique is that Tufte's goals are never spelled out, and his arguments, while sound, rely on assumptions that go unexamined--like that information-dense means of communication is always a good thing. He uses examples from business and science/engineering, and I'm not quite sure whether is audience is both of these, neither, or a superset of the two.

Other notes:

- PowerPoint (PP) has a terrible signal-to-noise ratio
- PP contains thinking due to small space limitations and focus on bullets; makes it easy to bury evidence
- Bullet points can be used to convey on a few things (order or importance, groups of similar things, sequence from first to last; yes, I realize the irony)
- Bullet points displace narratives, which _are_ an effective means of communicating
- Slides can only convey small tables and simple graphics due to their constrained size--we either have to spread out the information or dumb it down
- Often the complexity of an analysis, idea, or explanation cannot be meaningfully compressed into a deck
- We've been communicating complex ideas for ages with sentences--there's little reason to think the sentence doesn't work
