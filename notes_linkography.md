# Linkography

Goldschmidt


This was a totally random book I picked up at Old Crow in Burlington. The book describes a process called _linkography_. Linkography is supposed to be used to understand how people solve problems. It relies on something calls _protocol analysis_: basically, having people talk out loud as they think through a problem. From that stream a diaglgue, someone (hopefully more than one, and independently) go through each 'chunk' or 'move' or concrete thing a person said and code it according to some scheme. In linkography, you then ask yourself, of the `n`*`(n-1)` / `2` possible connections between chunks, where was an idea present in one of the moves surfaced in another move?

That's the basics of the method. Once you have this information, you can store it in a matrix or visualize it in any interesting tree-like representation. You can also squint and find patterns. You can compute all sorts of interesting quantities quite easily with the data in a matrix form, and you can make all sorts of inferences.

Overall, the book felt like an example of someone getting obsessed with a methodology and forgetting what problem they are trying to solve or what process they want to understand. I admit, I got into the book for some reason and thought the methodology was interesting, but at the end of the book I looked around and thought, "OK, what have we actually learned here about how people solve problems or approach design?" There was no response. 

Some additional criticisms:

- Protocol analysis itself is not only subjective and very time intensive, but my guess is that inter- and even intra-rater consistency of (a) the moves themselves and (b) the coding of each move is probably much lower than you'd want it to be. There's a lot of inferences being made on something that feels like it's reeking of false precision
- All these studies look at the process but they have no "response variable". There’s not a clear way to know whether a given linkography structure, e.g., leads to better design or worse, or to understand whether there are commonalities in the design process that lead to better outcomes. The author hints at this in places, and my guess is that linkography takes so much time and is so subjective that it would be practically near impossible to perform such a study
- There's a danger that this book shows very clearly of getting carried away with a methodology. Once we start talking about link index and critical moves of different thresholds, I felt like we were so far removed from the process we were supposed to be studying that I lost sight of what we were doing

There are some advantages of book. Tt illustrates how quantifying what you’re studying opens a lot up for you (matrix calculations, entropy measurements, all sorts of network statistics), I just don’t think any are particularly useful given the subjective and shaky foundations outlined about.
