# notes on Radical Candor

## some quotations

> You can draw a straight line from lack of guidance to a dysfunctional team that gets poor results.

> three areas of responsibility that managers do have: guidance, team-building, and results.

> To keep winning, criticize the wins

> Management and growth should not be conflated.

> The decider should get facts, not recommendations

> When the facts change, I change my mind. — John Maynard Keynes

> Praise in public, criticize in private

> “Culture eats strategy for lunch.”

> for criticism to be effective, it’s crucial “to do it very clearly and to articulate why … and to get them back on track.” (Quotation is from Steve Jobs)

> …competitive advantage tends to come not from one great idea but from the combination of hundreds of smaller ones.

## main ideas

- You have to form relationships with people that report to you. You get to know them, understand their goals, and what they want out the job.
- Scott puts forth two axes that describe how you interact with your reports. The first is the ‘care personally’ dimension, the second is the ‘challenge directly’ dimensions. _Radical candor_ is a combination of these. It’s a recipe for continual feedback, openness, and communication between you and your reports.
	- The _care personally_ axis comes from the fact that we’re all humans and need to be treated like humans. If bosses pay attention to the human side of things more people feel appreciated and more motivated to do their job. It’s also about acknowledging that your job is not your life.
	- The _challenge directly_ axis comes from the idea that you need to give people constant, more-or-less immediate feedback. If people don’t know their expectations, or the they’re succeeding or failing, how can you expect them to do good work? ‘Challenges’ should be clear, leave little room for interpretation, show the person how t get back on track, and articulate _why_ there’s a problem.
- The conventional wisdom for bosses is usually to challenge less; this knocks you into the ‘ruinous empathy’ ‘manipulative insincerity’—both are bad for you, your reports, and the company

#### chapter 3: understanding what motivates your team members

- Part of the goal here is to realize that some people are good at what they want to do and want to say where they are (“rock stars”); others want to climb up the latter (“superstars”). You need both on your team, and both are great for their own reasons. Don’t think someone isn’t performing well because they aren’t on a steep growth trajectory.
- “Rock stars” can often be appointed ‘gurus’, to-go experts, or help train people. Don’t let your crappiest employees train people.
- Remember that growth and management need not go hang-in-hand.
- You have to let go poor performers who have had time to change their behavior. It’s usually because they don’t like their job, so you’re doing them a favor. That said, make sure you’ve given the person the feedback they need to improve and think about whether they’re just in the wrong role.

#### chapter 4: driving results collaboratively 

Telling people what do to usually doesn’t work. You have to:
- involve your team in decision-making
- take the time to explain or persuade people why a given course of action is the correct one. At this stage, you should encourage dissent: if your reports feel strongly that there’s a better decision, listen to them

The ‘Get Stuff Done’ Wheel:

- Listen
	- Make people tell you what they think. This can be difficult, but ideally you want a culture where people can be open with their ideas.
- Clarify
	- talk it through, come up with identify potential problems and solutions, find a way that makes it super simple for others to understand
- Debate 
	- Debate ideas, not people. 
	- Have people switch roles and argue for the other position.
	- Create an obligation to dissent—make _someone_ take the opposing view
- Decide
	- the people with the best information should be the deciders.
	- The decider should get facts, not recommendations
	- Get to the source of the facts.
- Persuade 
	- use emotion, logic, and credibility
	- ‘show your work’: let other people know how you got to your decision
- Execute
	- Don’t waste your team’s time
	- You should help execute; being a manager doesn’t exclude you
	- block out time to execute
- Learn
- Repeat.
