# Artifical Unintelligence: how computers misunderstand the world

Broussard


- tech isn’t inherently good or bad—it depends on what consequences it has in the world
- all data comes down to humans counting things. **all data is fundamentally human. data is socially constructed**
- the example of books in philly schools. the bad data. all the ripple effects of using computers and digital books
- inevitably, there are negative social consequences to new tech
- machine labor as an alternative to giving people digitnity, rights (women, blacks in the 1800s)
- so much comes down to the data we collect and use
  - it limits out models
  - obviously no model can incorporate the totality of the world
  - but in a lot of cases there are presumably important data that are useful for predictions that simply aren’t recorded or capturing because it’s hard or impossible 
- are self-driving cars good? what impact would they have?
  - better use of human time
  - possibly more efficient traffic
  - possibly safer, particularly in some circumstances (after drinking)
  - but also
  - widen gap between rich and poor
  - ethical issues and culpability—what if a robot car kills someone
  - maintains roads and highways and all the problems associated with them
  - might lead to more cars on the road is driving is more tolerable
  - spoofing / jamming / adverserial attacks
- are tech people interesting in making the world better, or just move convenient? what’s does it mean if convenience takes descent as a core value of society?

>Thus far, we've managed to use digital technology to increase economic inequality in the United States, facilitate illegal drug abuse, undermine the economic sustainability of the free press, cause a "fake news" crisis, roll back voting rights and fair labor protection, surveil citizens, spread junk science, harass and stalk people (primarily women and people of color) online, make flying robots that at best annoy people and at worst drop bombs, increase identity theft, enable hacks that result in millions of credit card numbers being stolen for fraudulent purposes, sell vast amounts of personal data, and elect Donald Trump to the presidency. This is not the better world that the early tech evangelists promised. It's the same world with the same types of human problems that have always existed. The problems are hidden inside code and data, which makes them harder to see and easier to ignore. We clearly need to change our approach.
