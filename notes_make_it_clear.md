# Make it clear 

Patrick Henry Winston

This was a pretty decent book. I think there are other books about communication that are better, but I appreciated

- the breadth of communication tasks outlined in the book
- his background (computer science)


## VSN-C framework

He advocates for the VSN-C framework:

- Vision - The problem statement in a form that will make people care
- Steps - Your approach to solving the problem (i.e., the _steps_ you're taking to solve the problem). 
- News - Something recent you have done (maybe, one of the steps you've completed)
- Contributions - Explain in detail what you have done

I find the names in the acronym a bit confusing, but it worth highlighting the similarities to other ways to craft a story:

- Opening
- Challenge
- Action
- Resolution

These two frameworks are pretty similar, though I think I like the OCAR framework better because of the narrative tension introduced by the challenge. Winston suggests you should 'should your hand immediately'; to me, that destroys narrative tension. Personally, the best stories are ones where I get sucked in (to the background, the vision, the problem, the characters, etc.) and I don't really know where I'm headed, but I'm invested in the characters or the problem so I want to find out.

## Being remembered

- Use a slogan
- Include a symbol
- Don't try to communicate too many ideas at once
- Include a surprise (I might say: design or architect a surprise)
- Include a story (I might say: craft what you're saying so that it becomes a story)

## Outlines

He's a fan of hte 'broken glass' outline. Start with your subject in the middle. Big ideas come off in spokes. Smaller, related ideas come off the spokes. Iterate. Think of this as experimenting with your thoughts or how best to communicate them. 

## Presenting

There's a lot in the book on presenting; I'm just taking notes of things that I care about the most:

- Prepare of AV disasters
- Turn on the lights
- Turn nervousness into energy
- Memorize your opening and closing sentences
- Conclude with a 'contributions' slides outlining what you've done, not a boring 'thanks!' slide
- No one can listen and read at the same time. Think about that when putting text on slides
- Think carefully about titles if you use them. You should be able to get the story from reading the titles alone in order
- If you use bullets, think carefully about how the ideas in the bullets fit together. Is there a better way to communicate the relationships between those ideas?
- Use blackout slides. Same as the advice [here](http://www.howtogiveatalk.com).
- Use large text sides
- Consider a progress bar at the bottom of your slides
- Use props for emphasize and to retain engagement
- Don't just stand behind the lecturn -- walk around
- Don't use a laser pointer, play with your hair, or put your hands in your pockets.
- Maintain eye contact with the audidence. You can use the 'W' method
- Don't say too much! It's better that your audidence remember a single idea from your talk than for you to bombard them with 50 ideas they will never remember

### Answering questions

- Repeat each question. This is important to make sure you understood the question, but also important if others can't hear what question was asked
- How to punt on a question:
  - The confession: "That hasn't occurred to me before, I'll have to get back to you"
  - The after-the-talk: "I don't have a quick answer for that; let's chat after the talk"
  - The not-yet: "I don't know the answer, but it deserves a lot of attention" or "I've been thinking about that, but I haven't reached a conclusion yet"
  - The hard problem: "Answering that question will take years" / "That question deserves more thought than it's getting"
- If no one asks a question, you could pose a question to yourself. This might 'prime the pump' for future questions. But in general, if no one asks questions, you gave a poor talk.


## How to inspire

Inspiration flows from observed passion. People get amped when someone is excited about something! It's infectious! Let your audidence see how excited you are about what you're talking/writing about!

## Writing

### Starting

- Start with your vision. Some options here:
  - Use an 'If...then' opening 
  - Big questions opening
  - Interesting story opening
  - 'Imagine what it would be like if...'

### Ending

End with contributions. Remind the audience what you did / what the point was. Some options here:

- Bold statement
- 'good news'
- 'British understatement'
- grant insight

## Good and bad speakers in the wild

### Great speakers

There's a section in the book about learning from great speakers and writers. Below I thought about consistently good speakers from grad school and what made them good.

- Mike Ryan. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF268DP14ZE). What makes him a good speaker:
  - He makes everything into a story. You sort of get sucked into what he's telling you, and one thing he's saying flows into the next like honey until your at the end of the talk
  - He has a conversation with the audience
  - He looks at the audience
  - He's well-rounded. He'll draw in examples from literature or art. I find these sorts of connections really interesting
  - His slides are non-nonsense, contain little text
  - You can tell he's interested in what he's talking about, and he's constantly emphasizing the unknown
- Mark Kirkpatrick. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4idYwjjPxT4).
  - Thinks about the details, designs his slides very carefully. Slides contain only what they need to contain
  - Moves around
  - He talks to the audience, makes a lot of eye contact
  - He generally starts with a surprise--something that raises your eyebrows
  - His title slides always has some interesting, related artwork

### Poor speakers

I won't name names, but there are plenty of examples of poor talks folks gave in grad school. Here's why I think they fell flat:

- They didn't offer a compelling problem. Most of the time, I wasn't sold on the work that I was being shown. Some common reasons why people think you should find their work interesting:
  - This is unique
  - No one has done this before
  - This is the first time this behavior has been observed in a mammal
  - There is a gap in our understanding of X, but you haven't told me why I should care about X
- Poor presence.
  - I'm thinking of a certain professor whose work is super interesting and I admired a lot...but it was like he took a xanax before he presented. You could barely hear him, super low energy, didn't move around. It didn't matter what he was talking about: you were going to zone out.
- Too much information. This is Sterns' 'data dump' sin, where you think you have to tell everyone about everything you've ever done. You want your audience to leave with one or two ideas they will remember. Data dumps ensure this doesn't happen.
- Poor flow. In a lot of cases, it was clear that folks, esp. grad students, started in PowerPoint instead of with a pen and paper. These presentations could be meandering, or you'd come up for air at the 20 min part and think "Wait, why are we talking about this now?" Mapping out what you want to say and all your ideas first, _then_ translating them to slides, will guard against this.
- Too much on slides. It was common for folks to through a ton of information or many plots on a slide at once. It was often difficult to try to parse all the figures while listening to the speaker. These sorts of slides normally occur during data dump talks.
