# measure what matters

This book could have been 10 pages. It largely felt like an opportunity for the author to name-drop and solidify his bona-fides.


- an objective is simply what is to be achieved. By definition of objectives or significant, concrete, action oriented, and aspirational. Key results benchmark in monitor how we get to the objective. Effective key results are specific in time down, aggressive yet realistic
- Originated with Peter Drucker, and were incorporated into HP, and other companies in the 1960s, then fell out of favor
- revitalized by Andy Grove. Meant to avoid what Drucker termed the “activity trap “: stressing output is the key to increasing productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite
- I need to pair quantitative metrics with qualitative goals. But he doesn’t say how this fits into the OKR approach
- with cascading OKRs, organizational key results become objectives lower down. he argues that while there’s benefits to this, there are also problems:
  - loss of agility
  - lack of flexibility
  - marginalized contributors 
  - one dimensional linkages
- each key results scored between 0 and 1 (at google): 0 - 0.3 (red), 0.3 - 0.7 (yellow), 0.7 - 1 (green) 
- you don’t want to average 1: your goals were not aspirational enough
- OKRs should be more of a guide and self reflection device and less of a grade or report card
- “Aspirational goals draw on every OKR superpower. Focus and commitment are a must for targeting goals that make a real difference. Only a transparent, collaborative, aligned, and connected organization can achieve so far beyond the norm. And without quantifiable tracking, how can you know when you've reached that amazing stretch objective?”
- committed vs aspirational goals
- CFRs are like OKRs for HR:
    - conversations
    - feedback
    - recognition
