# emergence

Johnson

This was a very engaging and entertaining book, even if it was plagued by a lack of focus and structure at times, and was considerably better than a similar book I read around this time, _the perfect swarm_.

Some ideas I wanted to remember:

- core theme of the book is how individual things following simple rules can generate fascinating macro-level behavior ("more is different")
- a lot of the book was around how to _use_ principles of emergence in design (of organizations, social systems, etc.) which is a pretty interesting train of thinking
- the idea of genetic algorithms / evolutionary computing continues to fascinate me. these feel underutilized but I'm also pretty unaware of their history of application
- designing a system to learn from the ground up using emergence:
  - more is different
  - ignorance is useful
  - encourage random encounters 
  - look for patterns in the signs
  - pay attention to your neighbors
- later, the book discusses a computer scientist named Hillis who evolves randomly-initiated programs to sort better than previously-identified algorithms (successfully) by evolving the programs using an evolutionary process. Hillis couldn't explain _why_ his algorithms were better as he didn't design the programs, he just _designed the process_ that solved the problem
  - this is similar to how _nervous system_ approaches their work and I find this idea very compelling: define the high-level goals and constraints of the system you're trying to bring out, then design the process that can find a good solution given those constraints and goals
