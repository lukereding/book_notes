# thinking in bets

annie duke

- core point of the book: you can't judge a decision based on outcomes for all interesting decisions. outcome = decision quality + chance. judging the decision quality just by the outcome = 'resulting'. sometimes good decisions lead to bad outcomes 
- all decisions are bets, in a sense
- it's useful to quantify our amount of uncertainty about different outcomes when thinking about different branches of a decision tree
- we tend to think things are true _a priori_ and only sometimes revisit that belief 
- you refine your beliefs over time: belief -> bet -> outcome -> belief (updated)
- we should remain truth-seeking / continue to scrutinize our decisions even if outcomes are good. the good outcome could have been driven by luck
- we tend to temporally discount and value future states much less than present states
- practical stuff
  - 10-10-10: what are the consequences of the decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years
  - zoom out. take a longer-term perspective
  - Ulysses contracts - taking some action today to ensure that future you does something you want to do
  - several signs of poor decision-making
    - overconfidence 
    - signs of the illusion of certainty
    - complaining about bad luck
    - generalized characterizations of people meant to dismiss their ideas
    - signals we've zoomed in too much
    - the word 'wrong'
  - thinking about the future as manifesting one of several possible outcomes, and assigning some likelihood to those outcomes, which then we update over time in response to new information. those outcomes and likelihoods inform how we approach decisions
  - scenario planning. thinking about those possible futures. think about what futures each branch on the tree opens up
  - backcasting - starting from the version of the world we want to bring about and working backwards
  - premortems
- frameworks
  - another useful framework is CUDOS:
    - communism - data belong to the group
    - universalism - apply uniform standards to claims and evidence, regardless of where they came from
    - disinterestedness - vigilance against potential conflicts that can influence the group's evaluation
    - organized skepticism - discussion among the group to encourage engagement and dissent
  - a useful guideline to promote exploratory thought: "complex and open-minding thought is most likely to be activated when decision makers learn prior to forming any opinions that they will be accountable to an audience (a) whose views are unknowns, (b) who is interested in accuracy, (c) who is reasonably well-informed, and (d) has legitimate reasons for inquiring into the reasons behind participants' judgments / choices."
