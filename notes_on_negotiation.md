## notes on _the art and science of negogiation_

- there are many types of negotiations. the complexities dictate what strategies or tactics work best.

- the simplest form of negotiation is a traditional two-party seller / buyer type of negotiation. the buyer wants the lowest price, the seller wants the highest price. it all comes down to the buyer and seller's __reservation price__. this is the lowest price the seller is willing to accept and the highest price the buyer is willing to pay. the negotiation is the art of feeling out the other party's reservation price. there are cases where the seller's reservation price is higher than the buyer's reservation price; in this case, no deal is possible. 

- as a rough generality; if buyer opens with a bid of `x` and the seller initially offers `y`, as a rule of thumb, the agreed-upon price will be close to the midpoint of these two numbers if a zone of agreement exists.

- any information you gain about the reservation price is incredibly useful. you should put a lot of work upfront into forming a probabilistic belief in the reservation price of the other party. 

- it would seem that the easiest solution would be for each party to write down their reservation price and, if a zone of agreement exists, both parties agree to pay the midpoint. in practice, this inceentivizes exaggerating your reservation price, thereby making a zone of agreement less attainable even if such a zone exists.
