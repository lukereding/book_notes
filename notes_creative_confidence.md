# Creative confidence 

Kelley and Kelly


This book is supposed to be able 'finding your creativity' but I really felt it was more of a product management book in many ways. The top points of the book overlapped heavily with the themes of _inmaes_ and _making things happen_, though it was more from the perspective of entrepreneurship and generating ideas than coordinating a large team to get something done.

A lot of the core ideas in the book also distilled down to some of the ideas I've found attractive and useful in the past: things like 'question your assumptions' or 'eschew the default' or 'act with intention.'

To me, a lot of finding better solutions starts with opening your eyes to the world, realizing what could be better about it, and then finding ways to meet that need through prototyping / extensive experimentation and building customer empathy.


### chapter 1

- Creative confidence means believing in your ability to create change in the world around you.
- \* In this book, like in _making things happen_, they say that there are always three perspectives you have to keep in mind: business (is it viable?), tech (is it possible?), and people/customer (is it useful?). They argue the last one is typically over looked and it's the focus of the book.
- Understanding the people part of the equation comes down to building empathy with the customer/user
- When faced with a problem, _most analytically-minded people go into problem-solving mode and want to resolve the tension caused by the problem._ (I see this all the time.) That's great but typically doesn't give you the best answer. Creative folks tend to delay judgement for awhile, cast a wider net, and not rush to a solution so easily.
- __Design thinkers make everything a conscious and original choice.__

### chapter 2

- The biggest barrier to creativity: **fear of failure**. If you are afraid to fail you will adopt solutions that have been used successfully in the past instead of taking a chance on something better and potentially more impactful. Of course, there are situations where the default option makes sense, and you the environment in which you're working has to be receptive to solutions outside the tiny realm of the status quo
- People that succeed in creative endeavors experiment a lot and fail a lot. 
  - He talks about experiments as failures but a more productive stance is to frame experiments as learning opportunities. Experiments are small and quick and as a result you learn something you didn't know before. If the outcomes are worse, that's great: the experiment was limited in scope, constrained, so the blast radius of the 'failure' is reduced.
  - How do you create a culture of constant experimentation? How do you give people the opportunity and freedom to take risks and fail? How do you reward people for failing (think: Google's moonshot division)? How do you even _encourage_ failure?
- Do experiments and trust that something useful/interesting will emerge if you keep at it
- One way to embrace creativity: let go of comparison.
  - E.g. it's typical in companies to look at what competitors are doing and copy it. That will give you more of the same. Actually useful solutions will approach the problem in a way distinct from what everyone else is doing. 


### chapter 3

- Ways to spark creativity:
  - Choose to be creative (i.e., be conscious about it)
  - 'Think like a traveler': Travelers in new countries notice all sorts of things that habitants of the country take for granted. Try to adopt that similar perspective. Notice little details or think like a kid without preconceived notions--otherwise, how can you create something new?
  - Use 'relaxed attention'. Most ideas come to you in a relaxed state, like in the shower, when you first wake up, on a walk, etc. 
  - Gain empathy with your users
  - Do observations in the wild. This can help get at deeper _latent needs_ instead of thing needs the user or customers _thinks_ they have
  - Look for contradictions between what you observe and what you expect. (Connection here to _principles_ and constantly refining your mental models.)
  - Ask questions that start with "What if" or "Why"
    - Basically, be curious. And not fake curious. Actually be interested in the current state of the world and in what ways it could be made better. 
    - With customers, 'show me X', i.e., show me how you use this thing or interact with this service
    - Have them diagram it out--it makes it really clear what _their_ mental model is for how something works
    - Think out loud or have them think out loud


#### chapter 4

The point of this chapter is to have a bias towards action. You can't learn if you don't try things out. You can get closer to solving your problem only by thinking and testing things yourself.

- Prototyping and experimentation is good! It also means that it's okay not to plan a lot early on during the 'design stage' of things when you're getting a sense of what could work and establishing a clear direction
- You have to try things out and learn by doing as soon as possible
- __Often the first step towards being creative is to take initiative and action instead of being passive__
- Make lots of bug lists--the way I've framed this before is _enumerate gaps_ you see between the current state of the world and a world in which your life in easier / better etc.
- \* Super interesting anecdote: In a pottery class, the instruction tells half the class they will be graded on quantity of pots produced. The other half will be graded on quality. At the end of the semester, the students in the 'quantity' group produced higher-quality work. They had done more 'experiments' and had learned more than the students in the 'quality' group.
- Imposing constraints on yourself can be a way to stimulate thinking and ideas. I forget where I read this, but an interesting example of this: Name 5 white things. People might flounder for a bit. Then impose a constraint: Name 5 white things in your fridge. That task is so much easier (eggs, milk, cream, etc.)
- Ideally, prototypes show the end result, not an intermediate step. 
- Good prototypes tell a story
- \* Most analytical people do not have a bias towards action


### chapter 5

Not a very useful chapter, but a couple of interesting thoughts:

- People think of what they do as a job, a career, or a calling
- Look at the intersection between what you're good at, what people will pay you to do, and what you were born to do

### chapter 7

Some useful tools to use:

- Mental maps. Starting with a concept or idea and branching out ideas / related concepts and ideas. This is a simple but powerful technique and I don't use it very often.
- __The more broadly your define the customer experience, the more opportunity you have to improve it.__
  - This was a pretty eye-opening idea when I read it, and I think it explains in no small part the success of Apple. I.e., instead of just solving a single isolated problem or optimizing one part of the experience, they step back and try to understand more holistically what the customer wants, their needs, etc.
  - You can use 'customer journey maps' as a tool to help you understand all the parts of a customer's experience you can optimize. They give the example of a company making paint. Painting a wall is only one small aspect of the entire 'customer paint journey'. The customer has to realize they want to paint their wall, they look for colors, maybe they go to a hardware store and get paint samples, eventually they settle on a color, order the paint, bring it home, move furniture away from the walls, etc. etc. The point being that there's a lot that going into the customer 'paint' journey, and if you're on the team that's producing the paint, each step in that journey is a place where you can optimize or influence the customer experience.
