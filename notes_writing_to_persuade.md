# Writing to persude

Hall

This book was less didactic than I expected, and more a memoir. Still, there were some good nuggets in here. The author was the editor of the op-ed section of the _Times_, experience from which she draws on in the book. Thus the focus of the book is more on convincing people or changing minds when people already have their minds made up (as opposed to, say, evaluating options of some neutral problem).

The biggest takeaway for me is that people in general do not respond well to facts, and they only change their minds slowly over time. If you think about it for a moment and compare it to your experience, you'll likely find this to be true, and yet we typically arm ourselves with facts and logical arguments when we want to convince someone of something. This usually backfires and can make the problem worse.

Though she doesn't quite talk about it in this way, the way I'd summaries what I learned is: play the long game. Understand why the other person thinks what they think. Really dig and try to find the nugget of truth in their beliefs, no matter how abhorrent they may be to you. Start at that kernel of truth. That is your common ground. From there, connect that common ground to your point: should that in order to respect that common ground, the world needs to be different.

**For example,** suppose I want to write an op-ed that will sway public opinion in favor of reducing the number of on-street parking spaces in DC to support more bike lanes. I'd start by really understanding the people who are opposed to such a proposal--why do they feel that way? What's their background? Is there some history of parking in the city that I'm unaware of? Ideally, I'd target a small section of that overall audience if possible. Maybe I learn that people don't think its _fair_ to have something they feel entitled to taken away from them. So maybe the common ground is: fairness when it comes to transportation is important. Maybe that's a good starting place. And from there, gently introduce the idea that parking spaces represent a subsidy for a non-random segment of the population, and that by retaining cheap street parking, we're contributing to a less fair and egalitarian society. If I was targeting more conservative-learning NIMB-types, I'd probably take a different approach. The common ground there might be, the government shouldn't be getting out subsidies it can't afford. And then show how parking spaces are a huge public subsidy that only benefit a small segment of the population.

Random notes:

- Hall's 15 principles:
  - listen to people: it's about the people you're trying to convince, not you. you need to understand how these people feel, and why they think what they do
  - we believe what we believe. you are not going to change a belief someone has in an op-ed. for the most part, if you fire a bunch of facts at them that go against their beliefs, they will often become more entrenched than they were
  - respect your audience and learn to be empathetic
  - don't get into fights. Are you in mostly doesn't work.
  - play on feelings. We all respond to information that is emotionally engaging
  - understand moral values
  - emphasize your similarities. People are more likely to agree with people that are similar to them.
  - write about what you know 
  - Surprise your reader
  - be specific
  - tell stories
  - facts aren't magic. people generally do not respond well to facts that contradict what they think to be true
  - facts do matter -- make sure any facts you use are correct
  - abandon jargon
  - prune ruthlessly
- what experts find persuasive (this list felt interesting at the time, but seems muddled at best as I'm typing it now):
  - give a gift (like a physical gift? I'm still a little confused)
  - just ask
  - be humble
  - make people explain their positions
  - use charts and graphs
  - inform people of the socially-accepted consensus
  - understand what people fear
  - create friction to eliminate bad habits, and make it easy to establish new ones
  - be warm and friendly
  - target your audience through its values
  - call for small steps
- writing an op ed
  - in general, it has to be something really fresh, it has to be a new/fresh/well-written take on an old standard, or it needs to be by someone famous
  - find a different angle
  - make an argument and offer a solution
  - focus
  - get to your main idea quickly
  - think about order
  - get rid of all jargon and cliches
  - avoid the obvious
- creating stories (Will Franklin's book is probably the authoritative source here for non-fiction)
  - look for suspense
  - create a transformation
  - use images
  - be logical
  - make the ending count
- other general notes
  - possibly, a good way to argue: start by taking the stance of your opponent. if you're a liberal arguing against conservatives, find something in the conservative value system that you agree with or has truth to it. understand why people think that way. 'we all want the same thing.' then surprise them: show people that if we all want the same thing (e.g., diversity), then we have to change something about how the world looks now (a law, an attitude, etc.). the idea is: establish common ground, then show that in order to fulfill this common ground, we need to change something. this plays on people's need for consistency that caldini has identified. 
  - a lot of the book centers on principles that, if you've read other books on writing, will be no surprise:
    - murder jargon
    - prune, prune, prune
    - grab the reader in the first sentence / paragraph
    - show, don't tell: write with stories
    - write what you know, avoid what you don't know
