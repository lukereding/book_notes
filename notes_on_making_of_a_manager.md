# notes on _making of a manager_

## what is management

A manager's job is to

- build a team that works well together
- support team members in reaching their goals
- create processes to get done smoothly and effectively

The one-line version: __get better outcomes from a group of people working together__. 

A manager is doing her job if

- the team achieving great results and 
- the team is satisfied and happy working together

She argues that managers work on three types of tasks: those dealing with __purpose, people, and process__.

> The first big part of your job as a manager is to ensure that your team knows what success looks like and cares about achieving it.

You are not an IC as a manager. As a IC you generally only contribute in proportion to the amount you perform. A manager is in a better position to be a __multiplier__: her actions have a multiplicative, not additive, impact on the team's overall output and performance.

> Your role as a manager is not to do the work yourself, even if you are the best at it, because that will only take you so far. Your role is to improve the purpose, people, and process of your team to get as high a multiplier effect on your collective outcome as you can.

## the first three months

New managers generally fall into one of these categories:

- apprentice
- pioneer (founding a team)
- new boss (taking over a new team)
- successor (taking over your team)

Good questions to ask your reports:

- What did you and your past manager discuss that was most helpful to you?
- What are the ways in which you’d like to be supported?
- How do you like to be recognized for great work?
- What kind of feedback is most useful for you?
- Imagine that you and I had an amazing relationship. What would that look like?

With your own manager, you can ask questions like:

- What does it mean to do a great job versus an average or poor job?
- Can you give me some examples? Can you share your impressions of how you think Project X or Meeting Y went?
- Why do you think that? I noticed that Z happened the other day. . . . Is that normal or should I be concerned?
- What keeps you up at night? Why?
- How do you determine which things to prioritize?

### leading a small team

Two things can get in the way of people doing good work:

- They don't know what good work looks like
- They aren't motivated

A big part of this section is about how you have to build a feeling of trust between you and your direct reports. You have to trust them to do their best work and to come to you when they have problems or issues. You want your reports __to bring you problems, not hide them__. If you ask your report how things are going and she just says 'fine', that's a sign that they don't trust you enough to tell you what's really going on.

One interesting idea:

> My friend Mark Rabkin shared a tip with me that I love: strive for all your one-on-one meetings to feel a little awkward. Why? Because the most important and meaningful conversations have that characteristic.

You want to be a manager that your reports would work for again.

Your reports should have a clear idea about their performance at all times. Feedback should be constant, but it needs to be done carefully since

> People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel

Great managers play to the strengths of their reports. They find out what their reports excel at and use it to the team's advantage. Don't spend all your time on weak performers: it's important to elevate those that are doing good work and ensure they continue contributing to the team's performance. 

Don't tolerate brilliant jerks. It makes the rest of your team less effective.

> I now understand that personal and organizational values play a huge role in whether someone will be happy on a given team.

## feedback

Great feedback inspires you to change your behavior, which made your life better as a result. To do this:

- set expectations early and often
- give task-specific feedback as frequently as you can
- share behavioral feedback regularly
- collect 360 feedback

You should probably be giving feedback more often than you are. If you're giving feedback that isn't changing behavior, it isn't getting through to your report and it doesn't count as helpful feedback.

To be able to give feedback well, your report has to know that you care about them as a person and their success and development.

How to ensure your feedback is acted upon?

- Make it specific
- Clarify what success looks like
- Suggest next steps

A recipe for delivering negative feedback:

> When I [heard/observed/reflected on] your [action/behavior/output], I felt concerned because . . . I’d like to understand your perspective and talk about how we can resolve this.

Don't start with a long preamble. Don't backpedal or undercut yourself. If you're letting someone down about something, own the decision and deliver it straight. 

## meetings

Reasons for meetings:

- making a decision
- sharing information
- providing feedback
- generating ideas
- strengthening relationships

Make sure you give people a chance to prepare: the invitees should know what's going to happen at the meeting and why they were invited.

Also consider whether you need a meeting in the first place; often times we don't need or don't need to attend many of the meeting we're invited to.

There was some other stuff in here, but it was mostly redundant with my guide for meetings.

## making things happen

Make the vision tangible. It should be something concrete that people can visualize. You also want to make sure it's specific enough that people don't interpret the vision differently.

To get started, ask:

- Imagine your team in two years to working great. What would be different in two years compared to now?
- How would you want someone that works on an adjacent team to describe the team?
- What unique strengths does the team possess? What would it take to be twice as good?


Create a gameplan that plays to your team's strengths. Importantly, __focus on doing a few things well__. (Connection to good strategy // bad strategy.) Quote from Steve Jobs:

> Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things

People that achieve the most put their concentrated effort into few, not many things.

__Define who is responsible for what__. (Connection to the RUF book and the idea of transparency AFN accountability and Peter Thiel's management strategy at PayPal.)

Treat big problems like a series of smaller projects. Create a sense of urgency. Ask people to commit to their goals / action items publicly. (Again, connection to RUF.)

__Aim for perfect execution over perfect strategy.__ A great model that never gets put into prod produces no value; an okay model that is deployed can still create value and be improved over time.

> The best plans don’t matter if you can’t achieve them accurately or quickly enough to make a difference.

> Executing well means that you pick a reasonable direction, move quickly to learn what works and what doesn’t, and make adjustments to get to your desired outcome. Speed matters—a fast runner can take a few wrong turns and still beat a slow runner who knows the shortest path.

Quote from Bezos:

> Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow.

There's also an interesting example in this chapter about listening to your customers but not doing what they ask of you (Ford didn't end up building a faster horse). Users wanted a 'dislike' button on Facebook. That would have been terrible though. Instead, they did a bunch of research and figured out that what people really wanted was more nuanced ways of expressing reactions to posts. As a result, Facebook rolled out a series of sentiments that better encapsulated the range of responses someone might have to a post.

> if everyone understands and buys into what they are ultimately trying to do, the tactical, day-to-day decisions become easier because you can look at them through the lens of: “Which option moves us closer toward the future that we want?” When people don’t understand what ultimately matters and why, that’s when conflicts arise.
