# High output management

Andy Grove

The later parts of the book were pretty useful, and I found a lot of overlap between this book and _the successful manager_. Some key similarities were around adjusting autonomy / monitoring for your reports, that there is no ideal style of management, and the need for clear expectations. There's a good checklist in the back of the book, the chapter on performance reviews if worth reading before you write one, and he outlines the OKR in a pretty accessible way in the middle of the book.


### chapter 2

- you need indicators, measures, to understand the state of your system
- you can’t just rely on **quantitative measures, because they are easily gamed**: you need to pair them with qualitative measures (number of tables served, customer complaints)
  - can pair indicators to match effect and counter effect (inventory size and number of shortages)
- measuring something is usually better than measuring nothing
- measurements should measure output, not activity 
- increasing productivity is key—can be useful to diagram your processes, with a box for each step, set a reduction target (30-50%), and ask why each step is being performed. this can identify some steps that serve no purpose 

### chapter 3

- a manager's outputs should be measured by the output of their subordinates and associates
- he really reenforces the differences between activity—what you do—and results—what you achieve 
- a manager needs to shifts their activity and attention to the activities that will most increase the output of his organization: they should move to whatever point their leverage will be greatest
- he argues that a lot of information-gathering is valuable, particularly verbal information gathering because it’s quick. reports are important for self discipline but not for communicating things [?]
- **manager output = sum across all activities i of (L_i  * A_i) (leverage x action)**
- delegation can be high leverage, as long as both parties have the same information base and a common set of notions about how to go about solving problems
- recurring idea: quality control stuff when it’s at it’s lowest value stage (e.g., raw materials, rough drafts, etc.)
- if you delegate decisions to people, you need to monitor the quality of their decision-making: asks lots of follow-up questions to understand how they came to their recommendation to understand whether the decision was carefully thought-out
- increasing managerial activity rate
  - identify what your constraints are, the immovable prices of work, and move work around those prices 
  - batch work to reduce setup costs
  - manager schedules need some amount of slack
- all kinds of managers cite uncontrolled interruptions as a core blocker. solution is to but some sort of practice in place, like hold office hours, or out together documentation

### meetings
- in 1-1s, the subordinate needs to surface potential issues, things they bother him, which should trigger a look inside on the black box on the part of the manager

### planning
- he’s basically advocating for the **delta method**, though he doesn’t call it that:
  - there’s the state of the world right now
  - here’s where we want to be
  - what do we need to do to close the gap?
- **gaps today are yesterday’s planning failures**. if we want the world to be better in the future, we have to take actions today, but won’t see the impacts until later
- tactics at higher levels are typically the strategies of the next level down
- by saying 'yes' to something you are also implicitly saying 'no' to a bunch of other things

### chapter 6
- teams can be organized by mission or functional areas
- these are two extremes, and we often we to find a balance between them in the form of a hybrid org
- functional units (aka horizontals) allow the mission / business units to focus and not have to worry about common problems
- mission teams can be super responsive to the business, but that’s their only advantage (though it’s a major one)

### dual reporting
- basically, having two bosses
- one might be in your mission team, the other a more technical manager in a functional unit, or a committee of your peers
- leads to a lot of ambiguity though
- he argues that all hybrid orgs should adopt dual reporting 

### modes of control
- three modes:
  - free market forces
  - contractual obligations
  - cultural values 
- there’s a best mode of control based on complexity of the environment or tasks and degree of self interest:
  - high self interest, low complexity: free market
  - low self interest, low complexity: contractual obligations
  - **high self interest and complexity: nothing works**
  - low self interest and high complexity: cultural values

### the sports analogy
- when someone isn’t doing their job, it’s because they don’t know how or they don’t want to (aren’t motivated)
- **two levers a manager can pull: training and motivation**
- but: motivation has to come from within (connection to the start with why talk)
- needs -> drive -> motivation
- "if we are to create and maintain a high degree of motivation, we must keep some needs unsatisfied at all times"
- people can be competence-driven (want to learn more, mastery something) or achievement-driven

### task relevant maturity
- **there is no optimal style of management**
- **task-relevant maturity**: basically, how well trained and desiring of autonomy people are
- when this is low, manager needs to be more involved, provide a lot of structure 
- as it increases, the goal is to make sure the objectives are clear and support and encourage
- the model he’s suggesting is h**igh oversight and direction at first, then slowly move into monitoring mode**. but if something changes—the environment is different or the tasks change—the manager has to quickly revert back to more of the "micromanaging" mode

### performance appraisal
- there’s some good perspectives here on why performance management often sucks as a subordinate
- "The biggest problem with most reviews is that we don’t usually define what it is we want from our subordinates"
- **you have to look at internal measures (employee turnover, morale, error rates, etc) in addition to external measures (output)**. in a lot of cases, outputs today are the product of previous years toil—someone can show good outputs but be a poor manager, esp if you look at the internal figures
- there are some other good tips on performance reviews here, but it stuff we tend to already follow, like sending the review ahead of time

### two conversations
- if someone good is quitting, drop everything and listen to them. hear what they say, but also try to understand what the root causes of the problems are, and use that to suggest a new role at the company. do whatever you can to find a new role for the employee at the company if appropriate. 

Effective training employees is a very high leverage activity, even if it seems like a big time sink for everyone involved
