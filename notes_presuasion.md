# pre-suasion
Cialdini

A highly read. Similar in many ways to his previous book. In more modern terminology than he might use, this is a book around _framing_ effects

key ideas:
- preloading an idea, product, thought in the recipients mind before the decision moment
- the "whats-focal-is-presumed-causal" phenomenon
- "weakness-before-strength" tactic

- Reminder from his previous book that he identified six factors that are deployed routinely in the influence business. These are reciprocation, liking, social proof, authority, scarcity, and consistency.
- When people were asked if they match some stereotype or label, for the most part, they say yes. He attributes this to the "positive test strategy". When deciding, whether possibilities, correct people typically look for hits rather than Mrs., for confirmations of the idea, rather than for discount confirmations. Is easier to register the presence of something than its absence.
   -   Those asked if they were unhappy, were far more likely to encounter dissatisfactions as they thought about it and, consequently, with 375% more likely to declare themselves unhappy
- A primary point of the book is that frequently the factor most likely to determine a persons choice in the situation it's not the one that counsel most wisely there; it is one that has been elevated in attention at the time of the decision
-  to get someone to do something, You often don't have to change the persons, beliefs, or thoughts or attitudes or experiences. It's usually necessary just to alter what's in that person's mind at the moment at the decision
- anything that draws focused attention to itself, can lead observers to overestimate it's importance
- quotation from Kaheneman: "Nothing in life is as important as ypu think it is _while_ you are thinking about it" 
- Some research suggests that merely engaging in a single-chute evaluation of one of several established hotel and restaurant change,  products, or charity organizations can automatically cause people to value the focus upon an entity more, and become more willing to support it financially
- it's very easy for people to think about the good things that happen if they make a choice. Decision-makers are infamous, however, for not Concentrating on what it could do to them if the decision fails. To compare this, potentially ruinous over optimism, time needs to do to be devoted systematically to answering a pair of questions. (1) what future events connect this go wrong? (2) what would happen to us if it did go wrong?
- the "whats-focal-is-presumed-causal" phenomenon
  -  for example of two people are talking in a conversation, you're more likely to think the one who you can see talking is the more causal or influential person of the conversation
-  there's some interesting thoughts in the book about types of openers that work in different circumstances. For example, if people are driven by desire for safety, a popularity based appeal will be more effective. If people are more motivated by wanting to stand out to the opposite sex, than a more distinctive based appeal will be more useful.
- the "next in lin effect". someone who is speaking next ata meeting, e.g., will likely not be paying attention to what the previous person is saying, because they are thinking about what they will say. (i think this possibly explains a lot of what I observe in meetings.)
  - so, for example, if you're in a big meeting and want to make sure your boss likes your pitch, make sure you don't talk right before then, and make sure your seated such that your boss has a full view of your face, taking advantage of the what's-focal-is-presumed-causal effect
- Tip for ending work: always leave off when you're in the middle of the thought and you know how you want to end the thought. But keeping the finals feature of every writing session, nearly finished, you use the motivating force of the drive foreclosure to get back to writing quickly
- counter arguments are typically more salient and effective than arguments
   - a framework he offers:
     - pose a mystery
     - deepen the mystery
     - home in on the proper explanation by considering (and offering evidence against) alternatives
     - resolve the mystery
     - draw the implications for the phenomenon under study
-  initial incidental exposure, either to simple words or simple images can have a pre-suasive impact on later actions that are merely associated with the words or images. Think, motivational posters.
- Raters, reading a job candidates qualifications attached to a heavy, versus light clipboard came to see the applicant as a more serious contender for the job
- getting "psyched up" for exams is in a sense pre-suading yourself, or getting your mind in the right framework for the exam
-  there's a limit to persuasive effect. Attention to the first concept ready is the second for influence, and proportion to the degree of association between the two
- some examples of presuation in action
  - if we want someone to buy expensive chocolates, we can first arrange for them to write down a number that's much larger than the price of the chocolates
  - If you want someone to agree to try an untested product, we can first inquire whether they consider themselves adventurous
  - if you want someone to feel warmly towards you, you can hand them a warm drink.
  - If you want someone to make it careful assessment, you can show them a picture of Rodin's the thinker.
- to maximize the chances that a gift will be reciprocated, it should be meaningful, unexpected, and customized
- **research shows that there's a way to require instant trustworthiness by doing the following: a communicator who references a weakness early on, is immediately seen as more honest.** The advantage of the sequence is that, with perceived, truthfulness, already in place, and the major strengths of the case are advanced, the audience is more likely to believe them.
  - Another enhancement occurs when the speaker uses transitional words, such as however, but or yet â€“ the channels, that listeners attention away from the weakness and onto a prevailing strength.
  - This tactic works best when the strength doesn't just add something positive to a list of pros and cons, but instead challenges the relevance of the weakness
-  persuasion openers can produce dramatic, immediate shifts, and people, but to turn their shifts into durable changes. It's necessary to get commitments to them usually in the form of related behavior.
