# the end of policing 

Alex Vitale.



I found this book refreshing because the author was continuously asking: "Does this policy / system / institution actually improve the lives of people? Does it lead to a society that we want to live in and be a part of?" In that way I felt Vitale embodies what Popper would call the 'social engineer' as opposed to the 'historicist' (though one of the opening chapters does focus on the history of policing, though in many ways the history is immaterial to its impact in our society today).

The main trust of the book is that police sit at the intersection of a lot of society problems, and they probably shouldn't. Instead, for each problem, Vitale asks, "Is the status quo the way to a better society? and if not, what policies would get us closer?" In each case, he argues that having the police play a dominate role in issues from mental health to addiction to homelessness to schooling increases disparities of wealth, perpetuates racism, and increasingly marginalizes the most vulnerable in our society.

My other main takeaway that I found sobering and mature was Vitale's rejection of the common belief that revenge is justice. 

What follows are some loose notes based on things I underlined in the book.

## chapter 1

> The broken-windows theory magically reverses the well-understood causal relationship between crime and poverty, arguing that poverty and social disorganization are the result, not the cause, of crime and that the disorderly behavior of the growing "underclass" threatens to destroy the very fabric of cities.
>
> Broken windows policing is at root a deeply conversation attempt to shift the burden of responsibility for declining living conditions onto the poor themselves and to argue that the solution to all social ills is increasingly aggressive, invasive, and restrictive forms of policing that involve more arrests, more harassment, and ultimately more violence.

This floored me.

He argues that diversity and inclusion trainings are not news ideas, and there's little evidence to show that they can be used as instruments to affect meaningful change in policing practices.

> By conceptualizing the problem of policies as one of inadequate training and professionalization, reformers fail to directly address how the very nature of policing and the legal system served to maintain and exacerbate racial inequality...the basic nature of the law and the police...is to be a tool for the managing of inequality and maintaining the status quo.

Biases of officers and 'bad apples' miss the point -- even if these were to go away, the system of policing would still be contributing in inequality in our society because that's what it's designed to do. Recent reforms like body cameras have no been effective in meaningly changing the interactions between the most vulnerable members of society and the police.

> Part of the problem is that our politicians, media, and criminal justice institutions too often equate justice with revenge...Three-strikes laws, sex-offender registries, the death penalty, and abolishing parole are about retibution, not safety.

This was very eye-opening to me.

#### liberal views of policing

Police don't prevent crime. There's no correlation between the number of police and crime rates.

> They want the police to be better trained, more accountable, and less brutal and racist--laudable goals, but they leave intact the basic institutional functions of the police, which have never really been about public safety or crime control.

> The reality is that the police exist primarily as a system for managing and even producing inequality by suppressing social movements and highly managing the behaviors of poor and nonwhite people: those on the losing end of economic and political arrangements.



### role in schools

The police increasingly play a role in schools. As a result, the number of students arrested for non-serious, non-violent crimes has increased dramatically, which terrible consequences for the children impacted. he argues that it's in teacher's and administrators best interests to suspend or arrest poor performing students, so that the worst test takers are selected out of the population. He points to the negative impact that fear play in learning--students that are concerned with the threat of violence or arrest are not going to be able to learn and focus at school. In some cases the police play the role of counselors, but don't receive that sort of training; the bounds of that relationship are also limited when the counselor can arrest you. There's no evidence that a police officer has helped combat a mass shooter at a school.
