# notes on the pyramid principle

main idea:

- ideas should be hierarchical, i.e., adhere to a pyramid structure
- think carefully about the order of your ideas
- introductions should be their own stories
- always summarize ideas before you present the ideas

Your ideas form a pyramid. At the top of the pyramid is the overarching idea you want to communicate. To support the idea, you have sub-points. These are the next step down in the pyramid. And so on for as many levels you is required.

The rules:

- Ideas at each level should always be summaries of the ideas below them
- Ideas in each level must be the same type of idea
- Ideas in each level should be sanely ordered

## substructures within the pyramid

Each idea gets it's own 'box'. An idea is a statement that raises a question in the reader's mind because you're telling the reader something she doesn't know. Otherwise she wouldn't be reading. The idea should stimulate a question. The next level down in the pyramid should answer that question. Thus __thus vertical relationship between levels of the pyramid should set up a question / answer dialogue between you and the reader__.

One important idea is to __refrain from stimulating any questions in the reader's mind before you're ready to answer it, or vice versa.__ Example: Stating assumptions early on in a document. The reader likely hasn't had the opportunity to ask questions about assumptions at that point in the document; the information will have to be repeated elsewhere.

__Ideas within a level should form a deductive or inductive grouping.__ A deductive group presents an argument in successive steps. An inductive grouping is a collection of related ideas.

__Introductions should have all the components of a story: a situation, complication, question, and answer.__ The introduction should remind the reader of what she already knows and what question the document should provide an answer for. 

## building a pyramid structure

#### top-down

The easier approach.

1. Decide on the subject.
2. Decide the question.
3. Write down the answer.
4. Identify the situation.
5. Develop the complication. This should result from asking "So what?" about the situation.
6. Recheck the answer and the question. The complication should immediately raise the Question in the reader's mind.

#### bottom-up

More difficult.

1. List all the points you want to make.
2. Work out the relationships between them / form groupings.
3. Draw conclusions.

Then reserve-engineer the subject, question, answer, situation, and complication.

Other tips:

- limit the introduction to what the reader will agree is true
- put historical chronology in the intro
- always start with top-down
- use the situation as the starting point to thinking through the introduction

## introductions

The story is an effective means of communicating. You want to craft a story that creates tension: the reader must read what you've written to learn the conclusion, which destroys that tension. (Note the connections to _made to stick_ and _writing for story_.)

The ordering of the parts of the introduction can give different effects (I'm not sure I agree with this):

- considered: situation-complication-solution
- direct: solution-situation-complication
- concerned: complication-situation-solution

Remember that

- introductions should remind, not inform
- they should contain the elements of a story (situation, complication, solution)

Conclusions are hard and in general aren't necessary according to her.

## difference between induction and deduction

__Deductive reasoning__ is a useful way to think but a bad way to structure the flow of a larger narrative.

Deductive arguments work like this:

- make a statement about something that exists in the world
- make a second statement that comments on the first statement
- state the implication of the two statements existing in the world at the same time

An example, courtesy of Dale Watson:

- I lie when I drink
- I drink a lot
- Therefore, I lie a lot

Using deduction on the key line level--the second level of the pyramid--is really difficult on the reader, because she has to keep a lot of ideas in her head as she reads the document and keep reminding herself of the overall structure of your argument. __At the paragraph level, using deductive arguments is effective__; induction works best for the structuring the flow at higher levels. Whenever you have a single piece of evidence for anything, it has to be default with via deduction.

__Inductive reasoning__ brings together similar ideas in a group. For each grouping of ideas, you should be able to find a single plural noun that describes the ideas in that group. You should be able to look at the ideas in your deductive group and infer the summarizing idea above it; if you can't, your reasoning might be off. From the top down, the ideas should be MECE.

Inductive ideas either vary the subject and maintain the predicate or maintain the subject and vary the predicate. 

## questioning the order of a grouping

__Time order.__ Visualize the actions being taken for each step of the process to determine what the time order is.

__Structural order.__ This is the order that reflects what you see when you have something visualized. For example, a chart showing the divisions in a company. The parts the comprise the whole should be MECE.

__Ranking order.__ Use when you bring together things that have something in common. The order is the order of the degree to which each possesses the characteristic by which you classified it.

Often, it's useful to

1. Identify the ideas in a grouping
2. Simplify them to get at their essence
3. Combine any similar ideas and create grouping
4. Re-examine the points to ensure the point being made is correct and that nothing is missing.

(This isn't presented explicitly in the book, but she uses this approach.)

## questioning the problem-solving process

Routine problem solving via 'sequential analysis':

1. What is the problem?
2. Where does it lie? (i.e. what is the system or the process that produces the problem?)
3. Why does it exist?
4. What could we do about it?
5. What should we do about it? You should be able to visualize the world with your recommendation in place.

In defining the problem, it can be useful to show the current state of things, the desired state of things, and the difference between the two. 

__Logic trees__ can be a useful tool for understanding all the relationships in a system or process. A logic tree breaks down an issue, goal, or question into component parts, becoming more and more detailed as it grows. A particularly useful type of logic tree is called _activity structure_ and outlines what needs to happen to produce an undesirable objective. 

## questioning the summary statement

By summary statement, we mean an idea that summarizes the ideas in the next level of the pyramid.

To ensure your summary statement is correct, you should:

1. Check the origin of the grouping and make sure it is MECE
2. Make either (a) an action statement about something you want the reader to do, or (b) a situation statement, telling the reader about something. If an action statement, state the effect of the action. Ensure that you can visualize someone taking the action and that each substep will bring about the step above. If a situation statement, state what is implied by the similarity of the ideas.

"Every grouping implies an overall point that reflects the nature of the relationship between the ideas in the grouping. You should define that relationship for yourself, then state it for the reader. Always ask yourself of any group, 'Why have I brought together these particular ideas and no others?'"

## random thoughts from the book

Avoid 'truism' in argument: we all know X, here are some reasons. There is no point to such writing. You should be making a point about some specific problem. If you aren't doing that, your writing is vacuous.
