# Logic made easy

Bennett

Main takeaways are: I want to revisit formal logic from the _foundations of mathematics class_.

Types of propositions

A - "All S are P"
E - "No S are P" (okay to convert, e.g. "No chickens are mammals" -> "No mammals are chickens")
I - "Some S are P" (okay to convert)
O - "Some S are not P"


A syllogism is an argument that takes the form of two propositions / premises and a conclusion. If the premise are true, then it follows that the conclusion must be true. 

If / then syllogisms and fallacies:

First premise: p -> q

1. Second premise: p. Then q. Valid. Modus ponens.
2. Second premise: q. Then p. Fallacy, affirming the consequent
3. Second premise: ~p. Then ~q. Fallacy, denying the antecedent. 
4. Second premise: ~q. Then ~p. Valid, modus tollens.

p -> q == ~p or q

Common fallacies involving logical reasoning:

- altering the premise
- allowing experience / facts to interference with the logical inference
- language difficulties
- inability to accept the hypothetical
