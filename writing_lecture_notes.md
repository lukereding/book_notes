# notes on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) random video on writing for academics

- the goal of writing is not to explain what's in your head
- your function isnt to explain, it's to convince. you want to change the thoughts of other people
- you have to know your audidence and community to read
- you tell the community they are smart and amazing, but missed this one little thing
- the purpose is not to be new, it's to move the conversation forward
- you cannot be a perfectionist when you write--it makes no sense, your shit will be outdated in a few years
- outline:
  - problem (situation has to be unstable // cost and benefits)
  - solution
- you can't say 'there's a gap' or 'you're wrong'. the former often doesn't work because it assumes that knowledge is bounded (has he not seen an infinity puzzle?)
- you use your writing to think. but you shouldn't use that text to cause readers to change what they think about the world
