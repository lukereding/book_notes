# crucial conversations

key ideas:
- the choice between bringing something important up and telling the truth vs. keeping a friend is a false choice ("the fool's choice")

- what makes a conversation crucial? (1) opinions vary. (2) stakes are high. (3) emotions run strong.
- "you can measure the health of relationships, teams, and organizations by measuring the time between when problems are identified and when they are solved"
- the choice between bringing something important up and telling the truth vs. keeping a friend is a false choice

choose your topic
- signs you're talking about the wrong thing:
  - your emotions escalate
  - you  walk away skeptical
  - you're ina  deja vu dialogue
- ways to think about the topic:
  - Content - the immediate pain
  - Pattern - when something repeats itself
  - Relationship - gets to deeper issues about respect, trust, competence
- don't allow the topic to change unintentionally

start with heart

- it's useful during these conversations to focus on what you _really_ want (e.g., a better relationship) and think about what actions in that moment help you get you closer to that aim. it is very useful to ask this when you find yourself becoming more emotional or shutting down (moving towards silence or violence)
- a similar question that's useful to ask is: "based on my actions, what does it _look_ like I want to an external observer?"
- the only person you can directly control is you

master my stories

- ultimately, all your emotions come from inside you. no one forces emotions upon you. realizing this is powerful!
- the best at dialogue don't hide their emotions, and they aren't slaves to their emotions. instead, act on their emotions, thinking them out, which allows them to get to a place where they can choose among behaviors to move towards better outcomes
- the sequence of things that happen (path to action):
  - see and hear, i.e., we take in information, which is obviously biased and influenced by our emotions, backgrounds, history, etc.
  - tell a story. we attempt an explanation of what what the 'raw' data from above means, guess at the motive of the behavior. we add judgement about whether what we saw and hear is good or bad. _any set of facts can support an infinite number of stories_
  - we feel something as a result
  - then we act on those feelings
- we are hostage to our stories
- it is useful to step back and understand what story you're telljng yourself, then anchoring back to the facts
- three common stories:
  - victim stories - it's not my fault
  - villain stories - it's all your fault
  - helpless stories - there's nothing i can do
- all stories are incomplete / simplifications
- "with experience and maturity, we learn to worry less about other's intent and more on the _effect_ others' actions are having on us"
- to sum up: when you feel yourself moving towards silence or violence:
  - retrace your path
    - examine your behavior. is it getting you closer to what you want?
    - put your feelings into words. what emotions are causing you to act this way?
    - spot your story. what story is creating these emotions?
    - separate fact from story. what evidence is there to support this story?
    - watch for common 'clever' stories
  - tell the rest of the story
    - ask: what am i pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? why would a rationale, reasonable person do this? what do i really want? what should i do right now to move towards what i want?
