# crucial conversations

this books presented some very useful frameworks for having hard conversations. a lot of this echoed what was in _radical candor_, but felt more actionable and useful. there were also some connections to the manager trainings I've received at upstart and capital one, things like playbacks and split-tracks, expressing curiosity, making sure the 'pool of meaning' is as large as it can be, starting with 'micro-yeses,' as well as some of the things I've learned about giving and receiving feedback. I also really like the framework they provide for turning decisions into actions; this is woefully lacking for almost all decisions I see.

key ideas:
- the choice between bringing something important up and telling the truth vs. keeping a friend is a false choice ("the fool's choice")
- always be on the lookout for when people no longer feel safe in the conversation. if that happens, you need to step back and reestablish safety
- to cultivate safety, the other person has to know that you both care about them and care about their concerns
- 

- what makes a conversation crucial? (1) opinions vary. (2) stakes are high. (3) emotions run strong.
- "you can measure the health of relationships, teams, and organizations by measuring the time between when problems are identified and when they are solved"
- the choice between bringing something important up and telling the truth vs. keeping a friend is a false choice

choose your topic

- signs you're talking about the wrong thing:
  - your emotions escalate
  - you  walk away skeptical
  - you're in a deja vu dialogue
- ways to think about the topic:
  - Content - the immediate pain
  - Pattern - when something repeats itself
  - Relationship - gets to deeper issues about respect, trust, competence
- don't allow the topic to change unintentionally

start with heart

- it's useful during these conversations to focus on what you _really_ want (e.g., a better relationship) and think about what actions in that moment help you get you closer to that aim. it is very useful to ask this when you find yourself becoming more emotional or shutting down (moving towards silence or violence)
- a similar question that's useful to ask is: "based on my actions, what does it _look_ like I want to an external observer?"
- the only person you can directly control is you

master my stories

- ultimately, all your emotions come from inside you. no one forces emotions upon you. realizing this is powerful!
- the best at dialogue don't hide their emotions, and they aren't slaves to their emotions. instead, act on their emotions, thinking them out, which allows them to get to a place where they can choose among behaviors to move towards better outcomes
- the sequence of things that happen (path to action):
  - see and hear, i.e., we take in information, which is obviously biased and influenced by our emotions, backgrounds, history, etc.
  - tell a story. we attempt an explanation of what what the 'raw' data from above means, guess at the motive of the behavior. we add judgement about whether what we saw and hear is good or bad. _any set of facts can support an infinite number of stories_
  - we feel something as a result
  - then we act on those feelings
- we are hostage to our stories
- it is useful to step back and understand what story you're telling yourself, then anchoring back to the facts
- three common stories:
  - victim stories - it's not my fault
  - villain stories - it's all your fault
  - helpless stories - there's nothing i can do
- all stories are incomplete / simplifications
- "with experience and maturity, we learn to worry less about other's intent and more on the _effect_ others' actions are having on us"
- to sum up: when you feel yourself moving towards silence or violence:
  - retrace your path
    - examine your behavior. is it getting you closer to what you want?
    - put your feelings into words. what emotions are causing you to act this way?
    - spot your story. what story is creating these emotions?
    - separate fact from story. what evidence is there to support this story?
    - watch for common 'clever' stories
  - tell the rest of the story
    - ask: what am i pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? why would a rationale, reasonable person do this? what do i really want? what should i do right now to move towards what i want?

learn to look

- when you feel safe, you feel like you can say almost anything and people will listen
- silence (shutting down) and violence (becoming defensive or trying to bend people to your will) are core signs that the person no longer feels safe

make it safe 

- when you notice safety has been breached, step out of the content of the conversation, establish safety, then get back to the content
- it's not enough for you to have good intentions. _the other person has to understand that you have good intentions_. 
- two conditions of safety: you care about their concerns (mutual purpose) and you care about them (mutual respect)
- starting a conversation by sharing good intent is a good way to ensure safety
- using contrasting to provide context and proportion is a very useful technique to prevent safety problems. start with what you don't intent or mean. then explain what you do intent or mean
- creating a mutual purpose can also be useful for establishing safety

state my path

- it's not correct that there's just the choice between being blunt and not speaking up. the best at dialogue speak their minds completely but do so in a way that respects the other person
- we have to maintain safety when we talk with others by combining confidence, humility, and skill. the 'confidence' piece means: you have a valid perspective / point of view
- they encourage people to use the STATE methodology:
  - Share your facts. always start with facts, since they are less controversial and provide a solid foundation for the conversation
  - Tell your story
  - Ask for other's paths. open-ended questions are useful: "how do you see it?" "what's your perspective?"
  - Talk tentatively. that means: tell your story as a story (an _interpretation_) instead of listing it as a fact. the more tentatively you speak, the more open people become to what you have to say
  - Encourage testing. make it safe for others to express other points of view or other opinions
  
explore others' paths

- "people who routinely seek to find out why others are feeling unsafe do so because they have learned that getting at the source of fear and discomfort is the best way to return to dialogue."
- "to avoid overreacting to people's stories, stay curious"
- to encourage others to share their paths, there are four tools we can use (AMPP):
  - ask to get things rolling (what's going on? I'd really like to hear your opinion on this. do you see this differently?)
  - mirror to confirm feelings. (you say you're okay, but the ton of your voice sounds upset. you seem angry with me.)
  - paraphrase to acknowledge the story 
  - prime when you're getting nowhere. i.e., take a guess and ask for confirmation
- handling disagreement
  - State what aspects of the conversation you agree about. usually this is a lot!
  - Build
  - Compare. don't suggest the other person is wrong, compare views (I come at this from a different perspective. I see things differently--let me describe how)

retake your pen

- feedback only hurts when we believe it threatens our worth or safety
- your reaction is within your control!
  - control yourself. name your emotions and recall your worth
  - understand. be curious. ask questions and for examples, and then just listen
  - recover. it's fine to take time away to absorb the feedback
  - engage. examine what you were told. look for the truth in what was said instead of finding holes

move to action

- four ways to make a decision:
  - consult
  - command
  - vote
  - consensus
- putting decisions into actions:
  - Who?
  - does What?
  - by When?
  - How will you follow up?
