# First, break all the rules

Gallup

The main points and findings from this book emerged from a couple of large surveys Gallup initiated using both managers and workers. Unfortunately, there is very little quantitative about the book and we sort of have to trust that the main points are backed up by the survey results. That said, I'm inherently guarded by the binary language that book employs ("Good manager said X and didn't say Y") and it's difficult for the reader to judge for themselves whether most of these statements are actually supported by the survey results.

## Main points

- Similar to other books (e.g., _Radical Candor_), a common theme was that you have to _know_ and _care about_ the people that work for you
- There's a focus on self-discovery and learning what each employee likes and what they are good at and do naturally--their talents. The goal of the manager is less to 'work on opportunities' and more around aligning the employee's talents and goals to meet the needs of the organization
- Talents, knowledge, and skills are separate; talents cannot be taught or learned while the latter two can be
- There was a really interesting sidebar about customer (/ stakeholder) expectations (accuracy -> availability -> partnership -> advise). I can see this being a very useful framework for thinking through customer engagements
- Tangential, but important: you cannot learn how to be great by studying failures. There are so, so any ways to fail and far fewer paths to greatness
- 

## Intro

- They found that a employee's relationship with their manager mattered more than the company than they work for--"people leave managers, not companies"

## The measuring stick

- They claim that measuring the strength of the workplace can best be captured by knowing the answers to the following questions (the Q12 questions; they are roughly in order of importance):
  - I know what is expected of me at work
  - I have the right materials and equipment to do my job
  - I have opportunity to do what I do best every day
  - In the last 7 days, I've received recognition or praise for doing good work
  - Someone at works cares about me as a person
  - There is someone at work who encourages my development
  - At work, my opinions seem to count
  - The purposes of my company makes me feel my job is important
  - My fellow employees are committed to doing quality work
  - I have a best friend at work
  - In the last six months, someone has talked to me about my progress
  - In the last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn and grow

- The lack of questions around pay / benefits doesn't mean they are important, it just means that they are equally important to all employees
- In their surveys, answers to each of these questions was related to some tangible business outcome
- The first 6 questions were most important--as a manager, you want to secure top scores to these questions
- A hierarchy of needs at work
  - Level 1: What do I get? Q1- Q2
  - Level 2: What do I give? Q3 - Q6
  - Level 3: Doing I belong here? Q7 - Q10
  - Level 4: How can we all grow? Q11 - Q12
- The answers to the first questions must be met first in order to ascend the hierarchy 
- Therefore, the focus of managers should be the first six questions, i.e., ensuring that the most basic needs are met

## The wisdom of great managers

- Great managers knows the people are unique and each has their own sets of motivations and style of working
- _They try to help each person become more and more of who they already are_
- The goal of the manager is to realize the talents in each employee and translate them into performance
- The get positive answers to the first six questions, a manager must do four things; each corresponds with one of the four keys of the remaining chapters:
  - select a person -> select for talent
  - set expectations -> define the right outcomes 
  - motivate the person -> focus on strengths 
  - develop the person -> find the right fit
- Managers look _inward_--into people, their motivations, goals, and needs--while leaders look _outward_ at competition, broad patterns, finding connections, etc.
- The great managers in their survey said things like
  - People don't change that much
  - Don't waste time trying to put in what was left out

## The first key: select for talent

- A _talent_ is a recurring pattern of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be productively applied
- The key to performance is finding a match between your role and your talents
- The best managers are good at spotting talent and repositioning employees so that they have an opportunity to use that talent in their role
- Talents vs. skills and knowledge
- Three kinds of talent:
  - striving
  - thinking 
  - relating
- Talents are commonplace--everyone has some talent (i.e., has some filter, some recurring patterns of behavior)
- All roles require talent. They give an example of how the best housekeepers have specific talents that allow them to excel as housekeepers; people without these talent would not be able to be great housekeepers 
- It can be useful during the interview process to focus on one talent within each of the three categories to focus on

## The second key: define the right outcomes

- Define the right outcomes and then let each person find her own route towards those outcomes. You can't force everyone to perform in the same way
- The allure of control for many managers is very tempting, and so many managers are tempted to dictate how the work should be done
- If you force people to do things your way, the will (a) reset you for it and (b) become dependent on you for doing their job
- Some managers are hamstrung by a fundamental mistrust of people--as a result, managers are extremely reluctant to let employees find his or her own route to performance 
- You have to trust your people; most of the time, if you expect the best from people, more often than that, they won't let you down
- There was a weird sidebar about customer satisfaction, but it might actually use a useful framework for thinking about interactions with stakeholders

#### Customer /stakeholder expectations

These are hiearchical:

- Level 1: Accuracy
- Level 2: Availability
- These first two can only prevent customer dissatisfaction
- Level 3: Partnership. They want you to listen to them, be responsive to them, and make them feel like you are 'on the same side of the fence'
- Level 4: Advice. Customers feel closest to organizations that have helped them learn

## The third key: focus on strengths

- Focus on strengths and manage around the weaknesses. Help each person become more of who he already is.
- Look for something to like in each of your employees
- Think of a bad relationship--most bad relationships are born from a partner getting to know you really well, and not liking what they found. That focus on someone's failings feels awful. Don't do this to your employees.
- It's wrong to focus on 'opportunities' that an employee can't change-you are setting them up to fail and blaming them for their failings, when they can't change who they are
- The best managers talk with people about their strengths, weaknesses, goals, and dreams. They notice things about their employees. They take their time and mine for those recurring patterns of behavior that define talents
- Treating people different is ok--you want to treat people as each person wants to be treated, not the way everyone is treated
- The best managers ask their employees about their goals, motivations, etc.
- The best managers devote the most energy / time to their most productive employees. If the goal is to instruct or control, then you end of spending the most time with your underperformers. But if the goal is to translate talent into performance, then you end up spending more time with high performers
- Great managers spend a lot of time simply observing their best people and trying to understand what makes them effective--you can't learn a lot about high achievement if you only pay attention to people that are failing
- Great managers do not anchor to 'average performance'--they hold a consistent, high bar. (Connection to _thinking in systems_ and '[drift to low performance](https://github.com/lukereding/book_notes/blob/master/notes_on_thinking_in_systems.md#system-traps-and-opportunities)')
- If you anchor to average behavior, you will underestimate what your people can accomplish
- Two common causes of poor performance
  - 'mechanical causes' -- e.g., they don't have access to the right tools or training
  - personal causes -- e.g., a death in the family, misaligned motivation
- If the answer is 'no' in both cases, then it's almost surely a talent issue. Training is not an option
- A nontalent becomes a _weakness_ when you find yourself in a role where your success depends on you excelling in an area that is a nontalent
- Possible solutions:
  - devise a support system
  - find a complementary partner
  - find an alternative route

## The forth key: find the right fit

- A manager's role is to steer the employee towards roles where they have the highest chances of success
- There should be multiple routes towards prestige and respect--manager-track should not be the only way to increase prestige, salary, etc.
- 'Broadbanding'--defining salary ranges that overlap between levels--can be a very useful tool to allow people to stay at the same role while advancing their career
- Some roles performed excellently at lower rungs are more valuable that roles performed poorly at higher rungs
- Its common in some industries for managers to make much less than individual performers who are very valuable. (Reminds me of TVL and how in general at startups the most highly paid person is in sales.)
- - 'Sunday night blues test'--if you feel yourself asking why you're upset the weekend is over, ask yourself why. What is your current role not giving you? 
- _Self-discovery is the driving, guiding force for a healthy career_. The point is to learn more about yourself so that you can capitalize on who you are and what you like to do
- Managers can aide in the self-discovery journey by
  - making an level playing feild. allow for multiple routes towards prestige, money, etc.
  - hold up the mirror. provide an outside perspective on the employee, give good performance feedback.
    - Feedback advise:
      - Feedback should be constant
      - Review past performance, but focus on the future
      - Feedback should be given in private
  - create a safety net. give employees the opportunity / space to try out new roles and fall back if the new roles doesn't work out. e.g., a trial period
- Understanding talent is liberating when it comes to having to confront poor performance because it _frees the manager from blaming the employee_
- Consistent poor performance using means that talents are not aligned with the role

## Turning the keys: a practical guide

- How to learn what an employee's talents are:
  - rapid learning - were their situations where the employee learned something quickly, or activities that have come naturally?
  - satisfactions -- often talents are tied to things we find satisfying

- Fixing problems:
  - If your manager is too busy to talk about performance / your goals: you have to tell them it's a priority and make time for it
  - If your manager is telling you _how_ to do everything: tell them you want to define your role more by the outcomes and less by the process. Ask what outcomes you should use to measure success
  - If your manager praises you inappropriately: suggest alternatives to him or her

Things companies can do:
- keep the focus on outcomes
- value best-in-class performance _in every role_
- study your best
- teach the language of great managers

## Random quotations

> I recommend living by this simple rule: Make very few promises to your people, and keep them all

p. 12

> Define the right outcomes and then let each person find her own route towards those outcomes

p. 116

> The hardest thing about being a manager is realizing that your people will not do things the way that you would. But get used to it. Because if he try to force them to, then two things happen. They become resentful--they don't want to do it. And they become dependent--they can't do it. Neither of these is terribly productive for the long-haul.

p. 122

> [Great managers] know that if, fundamentally, you don't trust people, then there is no line, no point in time beyond which people suddenly become trustworthy.

p. 125

> Standards enable us to communicate

p. 131

> By telling you that you can transform non-talents into talents, these less effective managers are not only setting you up to fail, they are intrinsically blaming you for your inevitable failure. This is perverse.

p 160

> When told employee was consistently showing up late for work, the great managers gave this one reply, which sums up their attitude towards manager employee relationships: "I would ask why."
