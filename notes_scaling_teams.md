# Scaling teams

Grosse and Loftesness

Overall, I thought this was a useful reference book. Some of the new idea or interesting framework I came across I'm listing below.

I'm skipping over the early sections on hiring.

### people management

- distinct from technical management, project management, and product management
- essentials
  - weekly 1:1s
  - clear reporting structure
  - clear expectations
  - managers should know career aspirations of their direct reports
- there's a lot in here focused on early growth companies, and when to introduce a level of managers, etc.
- developing new managers
  - identifying manager potential
    - cases where someone has successfully 'managed up'
    - good at collaborating with others -- don't take all the credit, recognize people for good work, don't point fingers
    - managing down - cases where the person has shown leadership on the team
    - additional qualities to look for:
      - mentorship
      - communication
      - emphathy
      - leadership
      - humility
      - strategic thinking
    - negative indicators:
      - inability to handle stress
      - difficulty communicating
      - desire for control
      - information hoarding
  - lightweight manager training
    - mentorship
    - professional coaching
    - reading groups
    - practice sessions
    - shadowing
- managing managers
  - improving manager skills
    - provide each manager with a mentor
    - establish a learning program
    - make someone responsible for manager quality
  - assessing manager performance
    - define expectations
    - timely feedback
    - performance != likability
- beware the 'null process'
  - "in the absence of a formal process, employees use unspoken expectations to understand how to do their job." => can have disproportionate impact on under-represented groups
- build a culture of continuous learning
  - ongoing eduction
  - mentoring
  - team learning
    - retros
    - post-mortems
    - cross-training


## scaling the org

- design principles
  - "you want a structure an organization over time so that hiring more people results in _getting more work done_"
  - intrinsic motivation
    - autonomy
    - mastery
    - purpose
  - beware brook's law (communication overhead grows expoentially as the number of people on the team increases)
  - need to look for 'warning signs'
    - too many meetings, not enough time for real work
    - takes longer and longer to push out features
    - fights about headcount
    - unclear to employees how they contribute to success of the company
  - org design principles
    - build delivery teams - i.e., each team should be capable of doing everything required to put shit into prod _without depending on other teams_
      - without delivery teams, you rely on lots back and forth between silos and the communication overhead is super high
    - embrace autonomy
    - establish purposes and measure success
      - balance quantitative numbers with qualitative measures
    - continuous delivery
    - continuous culture learning curve
- organizing delivery teams
  - there's a lot of interesting stuff in here about how to create delivery teams, and whether to align them to products, features, users, company goals, etc.
  - economies of scale between delivery teams
    - the risk of setting up autonomous teams is you lose both _alignment_ (e.g., knowledge sharing) and _economies of scale_
    - Spotify gets around this using
      - chapters - small family of people working on similar problems in a similar domain
      - guilds - more wide-reaching communities of interest to share tools, knowledge, code, and practices


## culture

- values
- practices
  - behaviors, rituals, rewards, celebrations
- core values as roots of the tree, cultural expressions as a branches
- why does culture matter?
  - recruiting
  - aligned, independent decision-making
  - tribal identity
  - constructive conflicts
- your team usually already has a culture based on those shared practices; you need to work with the team to make the core values super clear
  - step 1: discover the core values - what brought this team together? what ar ewe like when we're doing our best work? what's the most important thing we look for in new hires?
  - step 2: draft culture statement - are they useful? do they facilitate aligned decision-making?
  - step 3: practice what you preach
- there's an interesting aspect of 'shifting culture' using facebook's shift tot mobile as an example
  - motivate the change - explain it really clearly, which it's needed
  - leaders have to model the new behaviors themselves
  - watch for warning signs
