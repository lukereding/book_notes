# Multipliers

Wiseman

The premise behind the book is that poor leaders (Diminishers) tend to get 50% effort from their people, but Multipliers routinely extract 100% from their people.

Some general points:

- Multipliers are orchestrators. They don't direct, order, or direct work themselves: they orchestrate scenarios and processes where things get done and people feel they have autonomy. Their greatest contribution is in directing conversations, decision-making processes, and extracting ideas from people. They are not geniuses, but genius-makers: people are smarter when working with them
- Multipliers embody the growth mindset (see [notes on mindset](./notes_mindset.md))
- Multipliers have high standards and hold people accountable
- Diminishers assume that everyone is dumber than them and assume that they need to generate ideas and be accountable for everything


What follows is the outline of the book, pieced together from the end of chapter summaries; this is basically the entirety of the book, plus anecdotes for each point.

Multipliers embody five disciplines:
- the talent magnet
  - Look for talent everywhere
    - Appreiate genius of all types - think, "in what way is this person smart? what is their superpower?"
    - ignore boundaries
  - find people's native genius
    - look for what is native - what comes naturally to the person? what do they do automatically without being asked? connection to [the gallup book](./notes_first_break_all_the_rules.md)
    - label it - tell people, hey this is your superpower
  - utilize people to their fullest
    - connect people with opportunities - match people to the opportunities that make effective use of their talents
    - shine a spotlight
  - remove the blockers
    - get rid of the prima donnas, aka the genius jerk
    - get out of the way - "ignore me as needed to get your job done"
  - avoid:
    - putting people in boxes
    - focus on 'empire building' or just acquiring more people
- the liberator
  - liberators create an intense environment that requires everyone's best work and thinking
  - create space
    - release other by restraining yourself - the focus and core thinking should come from your people, not you
    - shift the ratio of listening to talking
    - define a space for discovery
    - level the playing felid
  - demand best work
    - defend the standard
    - distinguish best work from outcomes - the idea that sometimes you put in your best effort, but due to things outside your control things still don't work out; separate experiment from the outcome of the experiment
  - generate rapid learning cycles
    - lots of connections to the [netflix book](./notes_no_rules_rules.md)
    - admit and share mistakes
    - insist on learning from mistakes
  - becoming a liberator 
    - play few chips, aka, talk less
    - label your opinion - e.g., 'hard' vs 'soft' opinions
    - talk up your mistakes

    - create a starting point
  - lay down a challenge
    - extend a concrete challenge - e.g., to hit a specific number
    - ask the hard questions
    - let others fill in the blanks - define the target, but leave it to your people to figure out how to get there
  - generate belief in what is possible
    - helicopter down - we need to understand what's happening at a low level to gain insight into solve problems often, e.g., visiting the factory floor or listening in on calls with customers
    - cocreate the plan - create the plan _with everyone_ so everyone feels like they have some ownership in it
    - orchestrate an early win
  - becoming a challenger
    - take the extreme questions challenge - bad leaders tell you what to do; good leaders will ask questions and let their people figure out the answers
    - create a stretch challenge
    - take a bus trip
    - take a massive baby step - low hanging fruit, quick win
- the debate maker
  - engage people in debating ideas upfront, leading to sound decisions that people understand

    - form the team
    - assemble the data
    - frame the decision
  - spark the debate
    - create safety for besting thinking
    - demand rigor - opinions should be backed by data

    - make the decision
    - communicate the decision and rationale
  - becoming a debate maker
    - ask the hard question
    - ask for evidence
    - ask everyone - make sure everyone speaks

  - define ownership
    - name the lead

    - teach and coach
    - provide backup - ideally this is not a boss, but maybe someone more senior who can help out if needed
  - hold people accountable

    - expect complete work - e.g., if someone identifies a problem without a potential solution, that's not enough
    - respect natural consequences
  - becoming an investor
    - give 51% of the vote to your people

    - ask for the F-I-X - i.e., its not enough to identify problems: you also have to make a recommendation to fix it
    - give it back
- accidental diminisher
  - 'idea guy' - before sharing your ideas, ask others what their ideas are; debate the options
  - rescuer - ask for the fix / the solutions to the problem instead of swooping in to solve it
  - rapid responder - don't respond to stuff that falls on someone else's plate within 24 hours
  - protector - it's okay to have your people experience failure some of the time - they won't learn otherwise!
  - perfectionist - define standards up front, define what success looks like
- dealing with diminishers
  - don't take everything seriously - if your dealing with a diminisher, don't react to everything, you can ignore a lot of what they say
  - don't take it personally
  - strengthen connections exterior to the diminisher
  - if the diminisher has, e.g., a strong opinion, listen, ask for some more time, then come back to it - gives time for things to cool off a little and for people to becomes less entrenched
  - if your dealing with someone who wants to do a lot of the work, tell them you want to try to handle it all yourself
  - level 2
    - exploit your bosses strengths
    - give them a user's guide - tell your boss what your natural talents are
    - listen! often diminishers do have some key perspective that you might be missing
- becoming a multiplier
  - you don't have to be great at all five of the disciplines - must multipliers are strong in three, but you shouldn't be a diminisher on any of the axes
