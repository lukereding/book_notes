# smart, better, faster: the transformative power...
## charles duhigg


### motivation

- Transform chores into choices. We feel more motivated and in control when we can make choices. Even if the choice is small, like the decision to have a meeting at a certain time, can be motivating.
- Self-motivation is easier when we see our choices as affirmations as something innate about ourselves
- Motivation becomes easier when we see the tasks we have to do as working towards some larger goal. 


### goal-setting

- We need both __stretch__ and __SMART__ goals:
  - stretch goals: over-the-top goals. Often unrealistic, but with them, you go further than you would get without them. Stretch goals identify your biggest ambitions.
  - SMART- goals that are Specific, Measureable, Achieveable, and Realistic, with a Timeline

### focus

- Build mental models about what you expect to see or what you think will happen. This also helps refine your ideas about the processes that generate certain outcomes.
- Conduct premortems. When making a decision, think about everything that might go wrong. How are you going to prevent those worst-case scenarios from happening?

### decision-making

- Envision multiple futures, then assign probabilities to each one. Bet on the the liklihood of each outcome. Helps foster probabalistic thinking

### more effective teams 

- manage the how, not the who, of teams. Make sure everyone feels like they can speak safely without fear of embarassment. Make sure everyone talks. 
- Don't reward the louest people.
- Repeat what people say to make sure you're in synch and understand each other. 

### managing others effectively

- people should have a good degree of autonomy when doing their job. This is just smarter plus makes people feel more motivated. 
- push decision-making to those closest to the problem
- people need to know their ideas won't be ridiculed or held against them

### to encourage innovation

- creatively often emerges by combining old ideas and new ways. Start with crazy ideas then inject some level of familarity into them
- Anxiety and creative desparation is often a good thing
- Critique what you've come up with and always ask others for their thoughts

- Productivity emerges when we challenge ourselves and others to think differently.
