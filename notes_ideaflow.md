# Ideaflow

Utely and Klebahn

I really enjoyed this book. It struck me as similar to books like _creative confidence_ but was different enough that the material was never boring.

Core ideas:

- the more ideas we generate, the better the overall quality of the resulting idea is: "quantity drives quality"
- they claim you need ~2000 ideas for every successful idea _that works_
- they highlight a bunch of interesting brainstorming processes
- the emphasize (a) the role of unconscious processing and (b) creativity as connections between divergent ideas and the need to 'feed the flow' by involving yourself in stuff outside of your core domain

--------

- ideas as connections between existing thoughts in your brain
- **every problem is an idea problem**
- most brainstorming sessions are done wrong, but we still do them
- idea quota:
  - select a problem. think about it before bed
  - sleep
  - in the morning, as you're running or in the shower, think about it. write down 10 ideas
- **equal odds rule**- the more ideas we generate, the more good ideas we generate. people don’t have a single good idea in isolation. idea volume is the biggest thing. they suggest that you need 2000 ideas for a great idea
- in general, save anything that sparks your interest, even if you can't think of a use for it at the moment
- brainstorming process
  - assemble the right mix. it’s not productive to bring in a bunch of people who lack context, e.g. no more than six people should be brainstorming together
  - gather initial suggestions from people before the session. helps level the playing field (otherwise extroverts dominate) and bound anchor bias.
  - get in the right mindset. give yourself to think 'irresponsibly': without thinking about downstream impacts or resourcing challenges, etc. start with a parallel challenge. encourage 'yes and'
  - get into smaller groups. assign a facilitator. the facilitator establishes some seed ideas that were generated previously
      - set the pace. for each seed idea, encourage everyone to write stickies for ideas related to that idea. continue recursively. make sure everyone contributes. the facilitator encourages people to resist judgement. when the pace if ideas slows, go to the next column
  - capture and marinate. capture all the ideas. tell people to keep thinking on the problem. calculate the rate of ideas for each group as a sign of progress
- during this process, **don’t try to be creative**. sometimes what’s obvious to one person is nonobvious to most other people
- you need to execute small scale tests first. if the test is successful, proceed slowly, validating additional assumptions the first tests couldnt tell you, before rolling it out entirely 
- innovation is inherently a low yield activity—progress is measured by racking up failures
- think about portfolios of experiments—don’t pick the winners, treat it like investing
- you need a good process to filter ideas down to some you can test—decide on the criteria ahead of time based on what makes sense to your business. don’t just go after the low hanging fruit though. regardless, you should be excited about the stuff towards the top of your list. if it doesn't pass the excitement test, it shouldn't be on your list
- there’s a lot in here about using premortems to validate assumptions and understand objectives to testing or your idea before you implement it
- the need for very quick experiments with very rapid feedback cycles, but they don’t talk about stats at all
- of course, this idea assumes that short term targets are sufficient for what you’re trying to do. think of credit modeling though: there are so many lags and bad outcomes take months to manifest, so there’s a risk of relying just on very quick tests in some circumstances 

-------

- quantity and variety of ideas is key to overall idea quality. how do we generate divergent ideas? techniques:
  - learning circles
  - pen pals
  - ask a novice
  - customer council 
  - complementary collaborators

- to shake up assumptions:
  - find better problems. "it sucks that…" how can problems deepen relationships or provide an ongoing dialogue?
  - reverse your assumptions

- **generate a portfolio of frames for your problem**
these are all techniques to help you understand the problem from a bunch of different angles, some of which might be helpful
to frame things as **"how might we…" questions**:
  - scale. zoom in and out
  - quality. double down on an interesting part of the idea. or generate low quality solutions on purpose 
  - emotion
  - stakes. lower / raise the stakes
  - expectations. list all expectations, the. break each one
  - similarity. use analogy
  - subtracting things to introduce additional constraints
  - premortem
  - generate un-ideas. ideas for how things can go badly. has two purposes: there’s probably something good in each bad idea, and you can work to unearth it. second, if you list the things that can go wrong, you can make sure they don’t go wrong ahead of time; or: how would you just roll with things if/when those bad things happen?
- there’s a lot in here about creativity being forming of connections between divergent inputs, thus the need to mine or proactively go into the world and feed your mind more inputs, via art, poetry, etc, something you aren’t used to 
- a formula:
  - how might we do x?
  - who does x really well?
  - ponder on a walk
  - generate new frames, eg, “how can we earn trust quickly, much like a barber does with her clients?”
- the importance of stepping away from the problem, doing something else, relaxing the mind, letting your subconscious do it’s work
- there's a good bit in here about emphathy interviews to shift your perspective
  - the main points are to just observe people _as if they were using the product when you aren't there_
  - there's a lot you can do to bias how they interact with the product, but that won't tell you what you need to know
- **"most of us, most of the time, optimize for efficiency. we get better at doing that we've already been doing. true innovation requires rethinking the fundamentals and, to do that, you must _see_ them."** page 190
- **"when the answers run dry, ask a better question"**

be: relaxed, yet purposeful
