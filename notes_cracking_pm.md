# Cracking the PM career

This was not a light book, but it was well worth reading. I loved the focus on frameworks and their holistic approach to product management.


#### chapter 4 | user insight

- speak with users and potential users
  - dig beyond surface and stated needs!
- validate your assumptions
- growth
  - cultivate a beginner's mindset
    - think of the world through a foreigner's or a baby's eyes
  - connect product choices to customer insights
  - category insights by priority
- frameworks
  - jobs to be done
    - people don't buy products, they 'hire' them to make progress in specific circumstances
    - `When I <situation>, I was to <motivation>, so that I can <expected outcome>`
  - customer journey
  - useability guidelines (also applies to software products, platforms, etc.)
    - visibility os system status
    - user control and freedom
    - consistency and standards
    - error prevention
    - recognition rather than recall
    - flexibility and efficiency of use
    - minimalist design
    - help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
    - help and documentation
  - user research


#### chapter 6 | analytical problem solving

- often emerges from the ruthless pursuit of understanding something
- identify and structure ambiguous problems
  - most ambiguous problems come in two flavors:
    - exploratory problems: we don't have a good idea of the potential solutions to our problem
      - think of a few ways to slice up the problem space
      - then brainstorm solutions within each space
    - decision-making problems: we don't know which of some clear alternatives is best
      - usually the problem here is information overload
      - your goal is to simplify the problem down to the core, important tradeoffs
      - if you have a bunch of potential solutions, you can position them across the core consideration(s) (e.g., complexity, short- vs. long-term, build vs buy)
- look at hte data yourself
- systems thinking
  - allows you to see how different parts of a system connect ot each other, to ask the right questions, and to make decisions that account for how those interconnected parts will be affected. concepts:
    - feedback loops
    - cannibalization
    - funnel stages
    - flexibility
- growth practices
  - be curious: predict and explore
    - in general, always be doing this
  - don't just point out problems 
    - it's easy to say: here's a problem. it's much harder, but more useful, to say, "i can find a way to make that work"
  - articulate your frameworks
    - it shows people the logic and consistency behind your decisions.
    - writing them down gives you something concrete to improve on
    - leads to
      - higher credibility
      - less team frustration
      - greater efficiency 
      - improved decision-making
  - visualize how it's built
- frameworks
  - 2x2 matrix. the axis are the things you are about, fill the cells with different options. often doing this illuminates new options
  - red / yellow / green table, aka, the mighty decision matrix
  - if ... then
    - e.g., if we're optimizing for X, then Y is the best choice. If we're optimizing for A, then B is the best choice, etc. Organize these into a tables. Forces people to make tradeoffs about what's most important
  - decision tree. each node is a question and the branches are possible answers
  - the five 'whys'


#### chapter 7 | product design skills

- critical to understand user needs
- design sprint
  - gather info
  - choose the problem, goals, and metrics of success
  - ideate
  - select concept to prototype
  - make the prototype
  - test it
- **connecting work back to goals is one of the most important PM skills**
- don't hide constraints and internal goals - e.g., tech debt remediation - make sure others are in line with your thinking about tradeoffs. you need to be able to explain to other people your rationale behind the compromises you're making. this helps build trust and credibility, and also shows more junior folks how to approach similar problems in the future. if people disagree with your rationale, you move the conversation to a higher levels about data, assumptions, and reasoning
- important to keep ethics in mind - "are we creating a world that we want to live in?"
- practices
  - find ways to speed up hypothesis testing
    - talk to users
    - prototype
    - run an a/b test
    - run a 'fake door' test
    - analyze existing data for patterns
  - build a product mindset: start from problems, goals (_not_ their stated goals!), and people's needs
    - **think in terms of problems**
    - **"what problem are we trying to solve?"**
  - develop your quality bar
  - consider more radical solutions
    - think about the constraints holding you back; can you push on any of these constraints? sometimes things you think are hard constraints really aren't as concrete as you think they are
  - frameworks
    - wireframes
    - brainstorming
      - independent first, then in a group
      - impose some structure to the brainstorming
        - e.g. assume 'different hats', something silly, something inexpensive, normal, etc.
    - solution trees:

```
             desired outcome
           /              \
      opportunity      opportunity
   /            \         |       \
solution      solution solution solution
| experiment | experiement  ...
| experiment | experiement  ...
| experiment | experiement  ...
```
