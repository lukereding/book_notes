# notes on Zero to One

- my main takeaway from the book for me was to build the sort of future you want to live in. Most people (including myself) never look into the future to know what they want to find there.
- a startup in the largest group of people you can convice of a plan to build a different future.
- creating value as a company isn't enough; you also need to capture some of the value you create. E.g. airlines create a ton of value, but they are barely profitable
- Theil argues that competition is bad: under competition, there are no profits. Competition also usually involves invoking trivial differenes between competitors instead of _creating_ something new and innovating. It also tends to involve copying things that worked in the past. He argues that you want 'monopoly profits,' under which you can actually think about and invest in the future (i.e. innovate). Competition can also lead to oppurtunities where none exist (e.g. online pet stores). It's more important to have a good market than to 'win' a competition over a tiny market
- He argues that we're less likely to chase slim competition and slim profit margins if we're actually good at something and stick to it
- Business are really defined by their ability to generate profits _in the future_, not the present (e.g. Amazon didn't turn a profit for a long time even when it could have)
- for a company to endure it must grow and endure; it's easy to measure the grow but hard to measure (and thus easy to ignore) the durability of the company
- characteristics of 'monopolies' include proprietary technology (must be >10x improvement or just incremental), network effects, economies of scale, and branding
- start small and build up: the perfect initial market is a small group of particular people served by no or very few competitors (think PayPal and eBay sellers)
- engage in definite thinking: have firm convictions, determine the best way to do something then do it
- look for secrets: things that are hard but knowable. Every great company is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside.
- Dynamism and history between a company's founders matters a lot
- Anyone that doesn't own stock options or draw a regular salary from the compay is misaligned
- A clean pattern: a company does better the less it pays its CEO. CEOs of venture-backed startups should have make more than $150k. Incentive pay encourages short-term thinking
- As a manager, make every person responsible for one thing. Reduces conflicts, people get good at the one thing
- Sales works best when its hidden.
- The kitchen sink approach to advertising--a little mid of magezine ads, online, salespeople, etc.--doesn't work. 
- The most powerful businesses of the future will empower, not replace, people. The things that humans and computers are good at compliment each other. 
- Seven questions every business should have a good answer to:

(1) Can you create breakthrough tech. instead of incrimental improvements?
(2) Is this the right timing for your business?
(3) Are you starting with a big share of a smal market?
(4) Do you have the right team?
(5) Do you have a way to deliver your product?
(6) Will your market position be defensable 20 years in the future?
(7) Have you identified an oppurtunity that no one else sees?

- You answer the 'monopoly question' by talking about your uniquneness, you've failed
- Huge markets are highly competitive and largely unattainable
- The best problems to work on are those that no one else is trying to solve
- The main point of the book: think for yourself. Make the future not just different but better
