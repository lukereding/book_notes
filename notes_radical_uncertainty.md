# radical uncertainty

Kay and King


Main points:

- the power of the question 'what is going on here?'
- the world is not stationary, yet most of the tools we have to deal with the future typically assume it is
- mysteries vs puzzles

This was a much larger book than it needed to be. I think it's best contrasted in my mind with _the failure of risk management_. In that book, the author says, 'risk management is currently practiced using these very crude, imprecise tools. we have better tools that allow us to be more precise. we should use them.' the authors of this book would counter, 'any precision gained from using some more refined toolkit is simply an illusion. all methods have assumptions, whether implicit or explicit.'

as an example, the core tool discussed in the first book is monte carlo analysis. monte carlo analysis relies on having a variety of input values across usually a lot of inputs to study the range of possible outputs. this should give us a better sense of the range of likely outcomes than using, e.g., just the point estimates on the inputs. all that's true. but it's also true that the possible ranges to use for the inputs _come from somewhere_, whether it's another model (even your model of the world, aka, judgement), or empirical estimates from the past. both assume that the world tomorrow will look, roughly, like the world today. if that's not true, your estimates are likely meaningless. in some cases, it'll be like trying to predict in 1980 how many people will have smartphones in 2010 - the question doesn't even make sense.

the authors argue in this book that there is a lack of stationarity in most systems we care about. their shorthand for this lack of stationarity is _radical uncertainty_. the world will change in ways we will not and, importantly, _cannot_ predict or expect. the implication of this is that the powerful mathematical models we've developed in recent years have serious limitations: they only work in stationary environments. and if the world isn't stationary, then we really have to reassess how we use those tools.

too much of the book was spent of a critique of kahneman's work on rationality and biases in decision-making. all the points they make about this—that the economic view of 'rationality' is very limiting and not representative of what we tend to think of as 'rational' behavior—was uncontroverserial and I think missed the broader point of prospect theory and related work, which was to remind the world that people do not act in ways that we typical assume in economics. whether or not we call this behavior 'rational' or not is a matter of terminology.

the authors correctly remind us that the view of rational choice is very limiting and divorced from the way all interesting decisions are made in the real world. in the real world, we rarely have a list of all possible options that vary on a few key dimensions. in the most interesting decisions, there are potentially infinite different options we have to decide between. there's an important connection here to creativity and some of the points that Rumelt makes in _the crux_. 

there were some interesting thoughts in here about the idea of a 'reference narrative': the narrative we have in our heads about some phenomenon. 

the authors also introduce the idea of mysteries vs. puzzles. a puzzle is something with a known answer. it might be difficult, but it is technically solvable and there is a technically a correct answer. a mystery, on the other hand, is more nebulous and doesn't have a clear answer. the authors argue that when we use sophisticated analytical tools to understand the world, we are mistaking the world as a puzzle to solve and not for the mystery that it is.

other quotations / notes:

- "to make a statement about probability in a real world, it is necessary to compound the probability derived from the model itself with the probability that the model is itself true. And there is no means of knowing whether the model is true; indeed, it is difficult even to attach a meaning to the concept 'the probability that a representation of the world _is_ the world.'"
- "Insurance is based not on calculations of expected value, but on the desire to protect the reference narrative of the insured"
- "all of this, potentially face similar problem. If we try to analyze all possible outcomes of all possible, actions that we might take, we will decide nothing, because radical uncertainty means that the branches on the tree of Bayesian reasoning multiply indefinitely."
- "the first company, sitting beneath the bogus ancestral portraits, had mistaken qualification for understanding, and confused forecasting and planning, in a manner which provided little help, but encouraged the proliferation of invented numbers"
- "the effective business strategy is a reference narrative – a part, qualitative, part quantitative scenario which defines the company's realistic expectations, and describes the means of achieving them. Having proceeded in this way, the participants would then have considered an evaluated the risks to that business, strategy, or narrative, to establish whether it was robust and resilient to multiple (and possibly unknown) contingencies."
- "in our experience, both of developing models ourselves in observing the use of models in political and business contexts, is that models are rarely used as an input to the decision-making process; their purpose is to help justify our already determine course of action to corporate boards or government ministers or external regulators"
- "a mystery cannot be solved as a puzzle can. Reasoning three mysteries requires us to knowledge, ambiguities to resolve them sufficiently to clarify our thinking. But even to frame a problem requires school and judgment... Framing begins by identifying critical factors and assembling relevant data. It involves applying experience of how these factors have interacted in the past, and making an assessment of how they might interact in the future."
