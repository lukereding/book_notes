# Back of the napkin

This book takes a couple hours to read and wasn't nearly as enlightening as I thought it might be.

The book does present some useful schemas, not all of them new:

### the six problem clumps

Basically the 5W's repackaged. Still a super useful (if basic) framework for making sure the entire scope of a problem is made clear.

1. Who and what problems (show a portrait)
2. How much problems (show a chart)
3. When problems (show a timeline)
4. Where problems (show a map)
5. How problems (show a flowchart)
6. Why problems (show a multi-variable plot)

### SQVID

The SQVID model is orthogonal the to framework above. It's useful for understanding at _how_ to present something.

Simple vs. elaborate
Quality vs. quantity
Vision vs. execution
Individual attributes vs comparison
Delta (i.e., change) vs status quo


The crescendo of the book: we apply each of these frameworks to a point we want to communicate. If we have a 'who' problem, we can do down the list of the SQVID model and choose, for the given audience / objective, what notes we want to hit (e.g. it should be elaborate and show the execution). Based on the spec we produce from that exercise, we generate a picture that shows it.
