## notes on _thinking in systems_

__Summary:__ Not a lot of this book was new to me--the first couple chapters seem like they could be taken from Otto and Day--but there's a lot in this book that bears repeating. In one sense, systems thinking is a compliment to root cause analysis: both make you look beyond the immediate problem at hand and towards the broader framework in which the problem exists.

## some common examples

I'll enumerate these here since they're used throughout the book:

- A bathtub filling up with water. Water flows in via the facet and out via the drain.

- A thermostat heating a room.

## the basics

A **system** is an interconnected series of elements organized together to achieve something. Systems are characterized by their __interactions__ and thus exhibit __emergent__ behavior: they are more than the sum of their parts. One result of this is that changing the individual pieces of the system might have some effect on the overall system, but changing the connections between the elements of the system has a larger effect.

A __stock__ is a quantity, story, or resource. Stocks are measurable. Stocks change over time because of __flows__ that move material out of or into the stock. You ideally want to understand the __dynamics__ of stocks and flow--how they behave over time. Stocks take time to change; they don't respond to a flow immediately. This can cause a time lag.

Behavior that persists over time is likely ue to a __feedback loop__. Feedback loops happen when changes in a stock affect the flows into or out of that stock. There are two common types of stocks. The first is what she called a __balancing__ feedback loop which acts to keep a stock at the same level. A thermostat keeps the temperature of the room at the same level via a balancing feedback loop: a lowering stock (temperature) creates a higher flow of heat into the system to keep the temperature stable. The second is called a runaway or __reinforcing__ feedback loop. This type of feedback loop will tend to increase a stock when there is already more of it--think exponential growth or compounding interest. Reinforcing loops, given enough time, always have to crash. 

Feedback loops are everywhere. When you think A -> B, think: might B -> A? How might A reinforce or reverse itself?

The concept of "who's to blame" makes no sense when thinking in systems; the question is "what's the system?"

## system zoo

### one stock systems

- __One stock, two competing balancing loops__ E.g. a thermostat. In these systems, because there's always an information lag or time lag between the behavior that drove the feedback loop and the present, the system never gets quite to the correct target. A thermostat set at 70 degrees generally hovers right below 70 as a result.

- __A stock with one balancing the one reinforcing loop__. E.g. population growth. The reinforcing loop increases the population size, the balancing loop causes the population to die via the death rate. In this example, as long as birth rates and mortality rates are constant, the population will grow exponentially or dies off dies off, depending on whether the birth rate or the mortality rate is higher.

Complex behavior can arise through via __shifting dominance__ when one feedback loop that previous dominated takes the backseat to another feedback loop that was initially less important.

- __A system with delays__. E.g. A car dealership that has to reorder inventory as demand changes. Often leads to __oscillations__ in the system. In the dealership example, the delay in (a) perceiving the change in demand and (b) getting inventory on the lot causes the dealer to waver between under- and over-predicting what she needs to order. Shortening a delay doesn't always result in the 'best' behavior of the system. 

### two stock systems

- __A renewable stock constrained by a non-renewable stock__. E.g. oil economy. The nonrenewable stock is oil, the renewable stock is the capital needed to extract and process the oil. A quantity growing exponentially towards a limited constraint--like oil in the ground--reaches that limit in a relatively short time frame. Think about yeast growing in a test tube. 

- __A renewable stock constrained by a renewable stock__. E.g. a fishing economy. 

Nonrenewable resources are __stock__-limited. Renewable resources are __flow__-limited.

## why systems work well

1. __resilience__

2. __self-organization__, i.e., the ability of the system to make itself more complex. Self-organization is often sacrificed for short-term productivity and stability. Self-organization can result from a small number of simple rules.

3. __hierarchy__ To go from simple -> complex, we need stable intermediate forms. The resulting complex forms will be based on a hierarchy. At each level, the connections within the level are stronger than connections between levels. Hierarchies evolve from the lowest level up--not the other way around. 

### why systems surprise us

Don't focus on short-term events; look at the long-term behavior, be aware of the boundaries, bounded rationality of actors, the limiting factors, delays, nonlinearities.

__Events__ are just the tip of the iceberg that reveal something small about the overall system. Don't mistake the event for the main course.

Look at the behavior of the system __over time__ to get a sense of how the system works.

Though linear relationships are easy to graph, many systems are characterized by __non-linearities__. They can change the relative strengths of feedback loops. 

The boundaries of the system are necessarily artificial. We should be careful about the boundaries we're framing our system in.

Think in terms of __limiting factors__. What's the thing that's holding this system back? If the system is a plant, what nutrient is holding it up from shooting out new leaves. (cf Liebig's law of the minimum). Whenever the limiting factor ceases to be limiting, growth occurs, but growth changes the scarcity of the other factors, so that a new factor becomes limiting, and growth slows.

Overshoots, oscillations, and collapse are always caused by delays.

### system traps and opportunities

__Policy Resistance__. A policy change is made to try and change a stock, but it unintended consequences because the policy wasn't make without a broader appreciation of the system. For example, Romania banned abortions to try and increase the population size. The result that growth rate temporarily increased, then returned to normal as woman got illegal abortions. In the process, more children were given away to the state, causing lots of problems. The way out is to either let go (do nothing?) or or seek a more mutually satisfactory outcomes for the involved parties. I might add: look at the flows, not just the stock? I.e. what is causing the low birth rate? Is there another policy we could take that might change the low and thus as a result change the stock?

__Tragedy of the commons__. The way out is is by (a) educating people, (b) dividing up the common resource so that users feel the consequences of their actions, or (c) regulation + penalties. 

__Drift to low performance__. E.g. falling market share in business or rivers that continue to get dirtier. The reason here is that the system is constantly re-orienting to the new state of the world, or, 'a reinforcing feedback loop' is reinforcing the poor behavior of the system. The way out is to keep standards absolute and un-changing with performance. 

__Escalation__. E.g. arms race, competition between two companies. I.e. one stock is always trying to surpass the state of another stock. It's a reinforcing loop. The way out is to try to avoid it in the first place. If it's too late for that, you can simply refuse to participate or re-write the rules of the game.

__Successful to successful__. I.e. the rich get richer. The way out: (a) diversification, (b) regulation imposing limits on success (e.g. antitrust laws), polices that level the playing field.

__Addiction__. The trap is formed when the intervention undermines the ability of the original system to maintain itself. "Addiction is finding a quick and dirty solution to a the _symptom_ of the problem..." The way out: don't get in! Shift focus from short-term relief to long-term restructuring. 

__Seeking the wrong goal__. Optimize for the goals you care about, not proxies. E.g.: we want national security, but as a result, we spend a lot on military spending. That spending may or may not produce national security. If we care about increasing the quality of education, we normally get a system that's really good at optimizing standardized test scores, which may or may not be indication of quality education. __Don't confuse effort with result.__

### leverage points

In increasing order of importance.

__12. Numbers. Constants, subsidies, taxes__. Most of our time is spent on these, but they are low-leverage. Numbers can tweak things but they don't change the structure of the system and thus they rarely change the overall behavior of the system. Parameters become high-leverage if the change in the parameter kicks off a feedback loop or one of things below on the list.

__11. Buffers__ Increasing the size of a buffer can stabilize a system.

__10. Stock and flow structure__. This has huge impacts, but it's really hard to do, so it's low leverage.

__9. Delays__. 

__8. Strength balancing feedback loops__ Think: preventative medicine, protection for whistleblowers, pollution taxes

__7. Reduce the gain of reinforcing feedback loops__. Examples: birth rates, interest rates, erosion rates.

__6. Increase the flow of information__. Without information, the feedback systems in the system don't run well. 

__5. Rules: incentives, punishments, constraints.__ Rules define the scope of the system, its boundaries, its degrees of freedom. Power over the rules is real power.

__4. Self-organization: Add, change, or evolve system structure__.

__3. Goals: Changing the function or purpose of a system__. 

(getting meta)

__2. Paradigms: The mindset of which the system arises.__ Paradigms include "more money is good," "growth is good," "individuals can own land". If you can change the basic assumptions on which the system is build (Einstein in physics, Copernicus, Adam Smith), you change everything.

__1. Transcending paradigms__. This is a little out there. Basically, all paradigms, all systems, all models, are simplifications are necessarily wrong, and with that wrongness comes a freedom. A freedom to choose whatever paradigm you want to achieve whatever you want to do. 

### living in a world of systems

Before you disturb a system, at least try and understand it. Watch it for awhile. See how it behaves. Question your assumptions. Pay attention to what the data tell you. 

When people are confronted with a problem, people generally leap to solutions: "predict, control, or impose your will mode" without having paid attention to the broader context of the system. (I find it's helpful, to stimulate this kind of thinking, to think about the 2nd or 3rd order impacts of the suggestion being made.)

Committing your mental models to paper is good practice. It helps you be clear to yourself and others about what you actually think is true. 

Information is power.

Pay attention to what is important, not just that which we can quantify. Pretending something exists because it's hard to quantify is bad. 

Policies should pay explicit attention to feedbacks. E.g. when Carter proposed a tax on foreign oil that would rise as imports rose and fall as imports fell. Or when Carter suggested we invest in Mexico so there would be less of an incentive for illegal immigration. 

Expand your time horizons. An action has some effects that are felt today, others that are felt tomorrow, and others that are felt more distantly.

## interesting quotations

> Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals. (pg 14)

> One good way to learn something new is through specific examples rather than abstractions and generalities (pg 35)

> Whenever we see a growing entity...we look for the reinforcing loop that are driving it and for the balancing loops that ultimately will constrain it.

> It is much easier to talk about hate in public than to talk about love.

This floored me. It's not just true, but it succinctly summarizes a lot.

> If we're to understand anything, we have to simplify, which means we have to make boundaries.

> Jay Forrester used to tell us, when we were modeling a construction or processing delay, to ask everyone in the system how long they thought the delay was, make our best guess, and then multiply that by three.

Things take longer than we expect them to take.

One powerful image I like: __"arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic"__. I.e. fiddling around with minor details that are totally important to the real problem at hand. This is powerful in part because this is a really easy trap to fall into (at least it is for me). I.e. many people with a business idea will get obsessed with the technical details without asking the real questions like, "Is there a market for this?".
