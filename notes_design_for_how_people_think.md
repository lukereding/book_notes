# Design for how people think

Whalen


I didn't get a ton out of this book. This book was very much for designers of consumer products with lots of users, and figuring out how to build something for those people. In that sense, it shared a lot with books like _inmates_ and _inspired_.

His core idea, which forms the backbone of the book, is that there are six 'minds' of experience:

- vision / attention
- memory
- emotion
- wayfinding
- language 
- decision-making

The first section of the book is basically him talking about what each of these means. In the second session he introduces the idea of contextual interviews: basically, watching a user interact with your product or a prototype, asking open-ended questions, then going back afterward and jotting the code pain points / ideas on stickies. You're supposed to align each sticky with one or more of the six minds and look for trends across participants. Towards the end it talks about prototypes a bit and ends with a unexpected and confounding but oh-so-topical chapter on AI.

Things I underlined:

- matched expectations can make for a great experience, and violated expectations. Can often destroy an experience.
- we as product and service designers need to discover what our audience’s hidden anticipations and stereotypes might be
- B2C communication often uses over-harding language that confuses customers, causing them to lose faith in the company, and end the relationship
- in many cases, novices (for example, first time homebuyers or car, buyers and parentheses, don’t defined the problem that they really need to solve because they don’t understand all the complexities and decisions they need to make. Their knowledge of the problem might be overly simplistic relative to reality.
- as product or service designers, we make no assumptions about what the problem space looks like for our customers. As experts in the problem space, we know all the possible moves around that space they can be taken, and often seems obvious what decisions need to be made and what jobs need to be done. That same problem they look very different to our (less expert) customers. 
- __we need to know what our customers needs are. Unfortunately, we can’t learn what we need simply by asking them...customers often just want to keep doing what they’re doing, the better… It is not a customers job to envision which possible in the future; it’s ours!__
-we also want to see the amazing links to which "super users"…go to to make existing (flawed) systems work
- he makes the point that additional data that typically ease to collect en masse (eye-tracking, mouse clicks, etc.) can be helpful, but there are limits, because these data don't help illuminate what problems our customers are trying to solve
- when talking about emotion, I thought there was a useful breakdown he presented:
  - appeal - what will draw in customer's immediately
  - enhance - what will enhance customer's lives over the next 6 months
  - awaken - what will help awaken your customer's deepest desires and goals? 
  - I thought these three were very interesting the think about, especially _awaken_ and how you can present products such that they help fulfill some deep desire, although this is the level where a lot of advertisements plays (e.g., a car commericial that shows a mom toting her kinds around as they grow up, which doesn't feature the car prominantly)
- people often define their goals based on their past experiences
