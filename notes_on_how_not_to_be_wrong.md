- survivor bias. e.g. if a lot of planes come back from a bombing run and have fewer bullets on the engine, and they _do_ have bullets everywhere else, you should fortify the engine. Those that have engine damage never make it back. Useful also for thinking about the characteristics of 'winning' groups in a competition. 
- Most lines are curves, not straight lines. When lines are curved, the best direction to move depends on where you've been. In general, this rule fucks up a lot of our thinking, which (speaking from personal experience) tends to be easier and more natural
- Any curve, however, can become a line if you zoom in enough.
- That said, using OLS for prediction (i.e. extrapolation) when the underlying phenomenon is not linear quickly gets you into logical inconsistencies. Always 'check your work' and make sure your results pass a basic sanity test.
- Be careful for using proportions to compare groups. Small sample size = more variable. The best (and worst) NBA players are those 2nd stringers that only shot a couple of times and made (or missed) all of their shots.
- **Don't use percentages when the proportion can be negative.** e.g.: US picked up 18,000 jobs in June. Wisconsin gained 9500 jobs. So Wisconsin contributed > 50% of the jobs? no! 18,000 is net. Can be positive or negative. 
- Beware the Baltimore stock broker. Sends out letters each week: Stock A will go up to half. Stock A will go down to the other half. He abandons those he gave the wrong 'tip' to. Rinse and repeat. If he started out with enough people, for some of the people he will have a given a string of correct responses. I.e. the stockbroker is cheating here because h'es given himself more opportunities to be right 
- Again, beware proportions: Increase risk of incidence by a factor of two sounds really bad, unless the proportion was tiny to start with
- Number theorists study prime numbers because every number can be decomposed into primes, just as matter can be decomposed into atoms
- Ask yourself what you want to be answering: The chance that the observed result would occur, given the the null hypothesis is true (what a p-value tells you) ~or~ the chance the the null hypothesis is true given the observed result. Usually we want to know the latter but ask the former.
- Once you've excluded the impossible what's left is the truth. Unless the truth is a hypothesis you've never considered.

- Rich people are riskier with their money because they can afford to be. They have the cash reserves to absorb any losses. So the can be profitable in the long term where a poor person, who can't absorb those losses, can't be. Basically, a rich person can afford place the same bets repeatedly if in the long run the expected value of the bet is positive, even if the variance is huge
- w/r/t the birthday problem: the result seems crazy until you realize that the relevant quality is the number of _pairs of people_, __not__ the number of people
- regression to the mean: whererver determinism and change interact. E.g. heights in humans. E.g. stock portfolios.
- Measuring lots of things that are correlated = not that much information gained.
- __Correlations are not transitive.__ X can be correlated with Y, and Y with Z, but X and Z can be uncorrelated or even negatively correlated
- No correlation between X and Y doesn't mean that they aren't related. It just means there isn't a _linear_ relationship.
- Things may be correlated because they have a common underlying cause _or_ they have a common effect (like putting you in a hospital). (think: the population you're measuring isn't the population of interest.)
- A good idea to keep yourself honest and sharp: Believe what you believe by day and argue against it by night.
