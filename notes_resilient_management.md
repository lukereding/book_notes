# Resilent management 

Hogan

This book had some interesting ideas, but I didn't agree with parts of it.

## meet your team

- to forster trust, you have to know your people
- The BICEPS model for core needs in the workplace. Everyone is more sensitive to some of these than others, and it's useful to understand where your team members fall on these dimensions
  - belonging
  - improvement / progress
  - choice
  - equality / fairness
  - predictability
  - significance
- List of questions to ask your directs when you start working together:
  - grumpiness
    - what makes you grumpy?
    - how will I know when you're grumpy?
    - how can I help you when you're grumpy?
  - feedback and recognition
    - In what medium do you prefer to receive feedback?
    - When do you prefer to receive feedback? (I think this should less be dictated by preferences and more by when it's most effective)
    - How do you prefer to receive recognition? Publicly or privately?
  - goals and support
    - what makes 1:1s most valuable to you?
    - what are your goals for this year? the rest three months?
    - what do you need from your manager?
    - what do you need from your teammates?
    - what do you need from your peers outside the team?
  - what's your favorite way to treat yourself?
- a lot of us are implicitly optimizing for something when we lead teams (team harmony/happiness, results, etc.) what we optimize characterizes our style in large part, but I'd argue that a manager should be able to assume multiple styles


## grow your teammates

- mentoring = advice based on your experience
- coaching (underutilized) = asking open question to encourage reflection and introspection, asking open-ended questions
- sponsering = finding opportunities for people to level up
- delivering feedback

## set clear expectations

- The idea of a RACI or venn diagram of responsibilities
- setting the team's vision and priorities (VMSO)
  - vision - the north star, articulation of the Beautiful Future
  - mission - a more grounded version of the vision that describes the team/s role as it works towards the vision
  - strategy - how the team goes about achieving that mission - it's about what the team is set up to do
  - objective - measurable goals that reflect the mission and strategy to help benchmark the team's progress
- keep a list of team practices
  - e.g., a list of meetings and why they exist


## communicate effectively

There's a lot in here about how to communicate broader-scale changes that makes sense, but feels less relevant to me at the moment.

You should be able to change your communication style to the specific situation (e.g., inspiring vs. concerned vs. rational)
