# notes on _made to stick_


## intro

Sticky ideas are understood, remembered, and have a lasting impact. The enemy of stick ideas is the __curse of knowledge__: it is difficult for us to understand what's it like to not know what we know. (Note that Pinker comes to the same conclusion in _Sense of Style_.) 

Some study found that most effective ads below to one of six 'creative templates' (the paper is [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0fad/4baf11e8b5a69ad1b039c643cd7d08ac5915.pdf)); less successful couldn't be placed in these templates. Good ideas often have a similar structure or tap into the same things.

## simple

> find the core, share the core

By __simple__, they mean 'finding the core of the idea.' The root of a sticky idea is always this 'simple' core: without it, your idea will fall flat. Simple ideas are simple because they represent a distillation, a stripping away, a prioritization. Simple ideas are not about dumbing down.

Use __schemas__--tie your idea to something your audience already knows. Schemas enable simplicity. Often schemas can provide a more labored route to the 'real truth' (e.g. there are no electron 'shells'), but they're a critical starting point. Similarly, __analogies__ are powerful because they explain a new idea in reference to something we already know. (e.g. _Alien_ is _Jaws on a spaceship._)


## unexpected

> get attention (surprise), hold attention (interest)

The best way to get attention: break a pattern. Violate a schema.

Numbers are hard to make stick. People rarely remember big numbers.

Create **mysteries** with your message. Mysteries are powerful because people crave resolution, even when they know the destination (think of all the predicable movies where you've sat until the end even though it's clear how the movie ends). Weaving your message as mysteries is also powerful because it in many ways mimics the scientific process (I think that was one of the reasons why I always liked Mike's talks so much). Mysteries come from unexpected journeys. Think about __turning points__: places in the narrative that hook the audience so they want to know what happens next.

The __gap theory of curiosity__: we want to fill in gaps in our knowledge to make our understanding complete. "The trick to convincing people that they need our message...is to first highlight some specific knowledge that they're missing." The perspective shifts from __giving facts => eliciting interest__ or __what information to I want to convey => what do I want my audience to ask?__. If your audience doesn't have enough information to understand the gap, __provide context__ to get them there. Point out what they need to know to understand the gap. (Think: watching some big sporting event rivalry of which you are initially unaware of.)

## concrete

> help people understand and remember

Great example: When members of the natural conservancy simply named some ecologically important area, they got people interested in the area. They don't mention this, but I'm also reminded of studies that show that people rate food more highly when it's called something very specific (e.g. blistered maple carrots with slivered almonds vs. baked carrots).

Great quotation: "Abstraction is the luxury of the expert." Novices crave concreteness. Start with a specific example. 

Concreteness can also help with goal-setting and coordination.

Also, consider Coopers personas in the _inmates_ book: part of the reason they're effective is because they are so concrete (each personas has a name, hobbies, etc.).

Concreteness also helps mobilize your brain and focus it. (Example of 'think of five white things' vs 'think of five white things in your fridge'.)


## credible

> help people believe

"Vivid details boost credibility"--though they also serve to make things concrete.

"Statistics are rarely meaningful in and of themselves. Statistics will, and should, almost always be used to illustrate a relationship. It’s more important for people to remember the relationship than the number." If you have to use statistics, always transfer them to something in a typical human's experience. (Example of comparing a company to a soccer team is more concrete and makes the teamwork aspect of a company clearer.)

__Testable credentials__--asking something to see for themselves--can be effective at giving a message credibility.


## emotional

> make people care; use the power of association; appeal to self-interest; appeal to identity

People give more to an individual suffering that to a whole region suffering (almost 2x). When people are primed to __feel__ before giving, they give more; when asked to so something analytical, they give less.

Need to tap into things that people care about. Often this is themselves. From John Caples: try to get self-interest into every headline you write. Makes your headline suggest to readers that here is something they want."

Don't emphasize __features__, emphasize __benefits__. (This also ties into the _inmates_ book; designing for goals, not tasks.) People don't buy drills, they buy the ability to hang their family photo in their house.

Don't just invoke base needs; most people are motivated  by their higher needs of self-actualization, aesthetics, learning, and esteem. 

We have to get people to not think analytically if we want them to care. "We create empathy for specific individuals. We show how our ideas are associated with things that people already care about. We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities—not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be."

## stories

> get people to act; stories as simulation or inspiration

Stories are often effective because they allow the listening to follow along. (That's also why, I think, the 'mystery' format outlined above is really powerful.) Stories allow for a mental simulation, which in turn helps for problem-solving and helps us think of things we might not have thought about.

Stories can also be effective because they invoke missing context. (Velcro theory of memory, the more hooks we put in ideas the greater the chance they will stick.)

Stories provide inspiration which can drive action.

Three types of plots:

1. Challenge plot. Someone faces a challenge and overcomes it (e.g. man in hole)
2. Connection plot. Story about people that bridges a gap (racial, economic, etc.)
3. Creativity plot. Someone makes a breakthrough or attacks a problem in a new way.

Keep a look out for these types of stories; they have potential for being sticky. You often don't need to develop sticky ideas yourself; you can train yourself to see them when you encounter them.

Stories necessarily invoke many other of the SUCCES criteria.




## other practical advice

For making an idea stickier:

1. Find the core of the message
2. Figure out what's counter-intuitive about it
3. Communicate the message so that it breaks your audiences guessing machines along a counter-intuitive dimension. Then help them refine their guessing machines.

Making people commit to a predict can combat overconfidence.

In ideation, imposing limits on yourself can actually help you think of things. (Example of 'think of five white things' vs 'think of five white things in your fridge')

When thinking about a problem you have, visualizing everything that led up to the problem, step by step, is a more effective means of solving the problem than imagining a positive outcome to the situation.

In one of the author's classes, only 5% of students remember the statistics that are given; 63% remember the stories that are told.

Sticky ideas have to make the audience:

1. Pay attention
2. Understand and remember
3. Agree / believe
4. Care
5. Be able to act on it

### symptoms and solutions

- If no one is listening, surprise them. Create curiosity gaps.
- If people don't remember, get to the core of the message better. Use concrete language. Use metaphors. Invoke schemas.
- If people are talking past each other, focus on something concrete.
- If people aren't getting excited, tell them a story about a single person; tap into their sense of identity.
- If people aren't acting, inspire with a Challenge plot story. Make the message simpler and more concrete.

## interesting quotations


> When you say three things, you say nothing. When your remote control have fifty buttons, you can't change the channel anymore.

> An accurate but useless idea is still worthless.

> Abstraction is the luxury of the expert.

> Business managers seem to believe that, once they’ve clicked through a PowerPoint presentation showcasing their conclusions, they’ve successfully communicated their ideas. What they’ve done is share data. If they’re good speakers, they may even have created an enhanced sense, among their employees and peers, that they are “decisive” or “managerial” or “motivational.” But, like the Stanford students, the surprise will come when they realize that nothing they’ve said had impact. They’ve shared data, but they haven’t created ideas that are useful and lasting. Nothing stuck.
