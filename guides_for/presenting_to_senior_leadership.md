# Presenting to senior leadership

These are mostly taken from _an elegant puzzle_.

### Start with the conclusion

### Focus on narrative

The best communication forms a story. Make sure your communication forms a clear story.

### Answer questions directly

Don't bullshit, obfuscate, or take more time than you need.

### Make it clear how you got to your proposal

You're generally talking to senior leadership because you want to communicate some point, get buy-in, or get them to do something. You can't just say "I'm asking you to hire more people." You need to communicate not just your proposal, but also how you got there.

If you're the senior leader and someone asks you for more headcount, you'd immediately ask yourself:

- What's the problem they're really trying to solve?
- What other solutions have they thought about?
- Are their clear things _I_ can unblock to enable their existing headcount to be more effective?

You need to head off these questions by _presenting your framework for how you got to your proposal_. As long as your audience agrees with your framework for getting to your solution / ask, they should be on the same page with what you're proposing.

### Don't raise questions in the audience's mind that you don't answer

It's super unsatisfying to read something that raises a question in your mind only to have the author not answer it. You have this lingering question that sticks around like an itch. It's uncomfortable. Don't do this. If you present analyses, facts, etc. that raise obvious questions, don't let those questions linger; answer them!

### Make a clear ask

It should be really clear what you're asking of your leadership--there should be no ambiguity here.

### Answering questions with 'yes and'

Senior leadership might press you on why you can't do A _and_ B so that they don't have to pick one. Instead of saying 'no, we can't do that,' it's more tactful to use 'yes, we can do that, _and_ we'll need to push back the timelines for project X be a quarter to make it happen.' This forces the question-asked to reconcile with tradeoffs that are inherent to the decision, and comes across as less negative that just saying 'No, we're not doing that.'

### Playbook

1. Remind the audience what the business problem is / what problem you're solving for
2. Give context and establish a historical narrative
3. Make the ask
4. Diagnosis. Explain the constraints of the problem and its scope.
5. Talk about your framework for making the decision.
6. Next steps
7. Make the ask again
