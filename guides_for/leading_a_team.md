These are rough thoughts I've gathered from the experiences of others and my own experiences leading teams during grad school (in research and in consulting projects with startups) as well as in a corporate setting. These are things I've found to work / be useful; that's not to say there are not other paths that would be just as fruitful.

These guidelines are colored by my thoughts about what the members on your team likely want. I think they want:

- to be empowered to make their own decisions
- to work on interesting problems
- to work with good people
- to make an impact


#### Lead with context, not control

This comes from Reed Hastings' book. People need to feel empowered if they are to feel engaged and accountable. They can't make smart decisions if they have no context. Context is how people weigh factors, determine what matters, and ultimately make bets / decisions. If you lead with control, you deprive people of autonomy and their motivation to do work.

I'll note there are there different levels of control. Figuring out _what_ do to is a different question from figuring out _how_ to do it. My view is that there are different job families that answer these different questions. E.g. the business unit might determine _what_ and _when_ while the engineers, with these constraints, figure out the _how_. Providing good answers to each type of question requires context. The business partners can't figure out the _what_ or _when_ if they don't have clear guidance and expectations; likewise, the engineers can't figure out _how_ without clear context of the broader problem being solved and what constraints need to be considered.

#### Push decision-making to the lowest level

One theme I've noticed from books business books like _no rules rules_ and _work rules_, as well as in more pop-psych books like _smart, better, faster_: decisions are better and people feel more motivated when given the authority to decide.

I think there's a tendency, especially in large, hierarchical organizations, to postpone decision-making until those towards the top of the hierarchy have weighed in. Yet these are the people that lack the context and appreciation of the nuances of the decision to actually make a decision well. The people closest to the decision, who are the most informed and the most impacted by the decision, should ultimately the ones who decide. They will feel more motivated as a result.

Many managers will likely scoff at this idea: clearly, there are lots of considerations that the people closest to the problem aren't aware of; maybe high-level business context or some new decree from the board. The people at the bottom of totem pole will likely make decisions that run afoul of these broader priorities. To which I might reply: that's a symptom of poor information flow in an organization that needs to be tackled head-on, not gently side-stepped. That's why, for example, Reed Hastings sits down with every director in Netflix several times a year at great expense.

This recommendation flows from two things: decision-making of a few higher-ups 'in the know' is impossible to scale, and the people who work for you can be trusted. If the latter isn't true, they shouldn't be working for you. The former feels like a pretty solid assumption. If your team grows from 3 people to 8 to 20 to 500, there's no way you can weigh in on all the decisions that are being made. At some point you have to trust your people and provide them with all the context they need to make the right decisions for the business.

#### Make expectations clear

I am always amazed when someone fails to do something and their boss says, "Oh, interesting, you didn't do thing X, tell me more about why you didn't do X, it is obvious that someone in your position should have done X."

I find exchanges like this infuriating. Why might someone not have done thing X?

(a) They want to do bad work    
(b) They forget to do thing X    
(c) They didn't know they had to do X      
(d) They deprioritized thing X    
(e) They didn't know how to do thing X / didn't have the resources for thing X   

In these situations, the boss if often suggesting that the direct report simply did bad work. But no one _wants_ to do bad work. No one _wants_ to suck at their job. (If they do, they shouldn't be on your team!)

So what's left: (b) - (e). It's possible they simply forgot. People are human and have complex lives, so that's possible and sometimes it happens.

What about (c) - (e)? In all those cases, I'd argue it's a failure of the person's manager to make it clear that thing X was an expectation and that they had the resources needed to do the job. If folks don't have the right context, they can make inappropriate tradeoffs that result in the wrong things being prioritized. If they didn't know they had to do thing X, it's possible that training is an issue if thing X is really something common, but it's likely just a lack of communication.

As I was thinking about this, I came across a passage in _The Design of Future Things_:

> Never label human behavior is "error." Assume the error is caused by a simple misunderstanding. Maybe you have have misunderstood the person; maybe the person misunderstand what is to be done...So, be tolerant. Be helpful, not critical. (page 191)

The context of the passage deals with the communication between machines and humans, but some aspects of interaction are universal. I thought the passage was fitting in part because it emphasizes the root of mistakes or errors really come down to misunderstandings or failures of communication. (b) - (e) above can be views as different types of failures of communication.
#### Create an environment where people have the resources they need to get things done

The idea is you don't want people to feel blocked or like there are a ton of obstacles in their way to getting things done. You can't deliver if you're constantly vying for resources, or trying to understand how a new tech stack works, or can't find the raw materials they need to get their job done.


#### Make sure values / priories are clear

Clear priorities and values makes distributed decision-making possible. You want "guardrails that are wide enough to empower but narrow enough to guide" (_decisive_, p 185).

#### Ensure people understand what success looks like

You can't expect a guest in your house to find the light switch by groping around in the dark without a flashlight. Likewise, you can't expect your people to magically alight upon the correcting working behavior without passing them some sort of torch so that they can start to see the outlines of things and what 'winning' looks like.

In many ways, this a reframing of some of the guidelines below but I find it useful nonetheless. When I led the TVL team my second semester, I started by giving a presentation and one slide that looked like this:

<img width="930" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11504400/109389459-b7653900-78da-11eb-917d-c64a3394a674.png">


Those aren't great in retrospect, but at least, at the very start of the project, folks had a clear idea of the sorts of behaviors that were expected of them. If the team wasn't producing quality deliverables, or if communication was getting jammed, or if we had stalled on a project, it meant that we weren't trending towards success.

#### Make sure the vision is clear

Make sure the team can always answer: Where are we going and how are we getting there?

#### Frame everything as a problem

When Bruno Munari talked about the task of designing a new chair, for instance, or an advertisement for soap, he framed it as 'a problem to be solved'.

When you frame things as problems, a few things happen:

- People become aligned to finding meaningful solutions. The major sin I see in delivery-oriented business units is that people become wed to solutions. We pick a solution and everything becomes about the solution and we lose sight of whether it's actually solving the core problem we care about. By framing everything as a problem, you begin to mitigate this impulse.
- Solutions for other problems become fair game. A familiar refrain from Polya's book, _how to solve it_, is to apply a solution from a related solved problem, or to solve a simpler related problems. Both of these are useful techniques and both are allowed by the framing of a team's objective as a problem to be solved.
- Your team adopts a 'product' mindset. When you frame everything as a problem, you never lose sight of your customers and what you're trying to achieve. When you frame things in terms of solutions, the customer is irrelevant. The task becomes about the low-level details of the solution instead of meeting some need.


#### Make sure timelines are clear

#### Give everyone ownership of something

That something can be little. But people should feel like they own as aspect of the project. They should feel responsible for it.

#### Creating teams

When creating teams, look for people that are:

- hungry
- smart 
- humble



to be classified later:

- make sure you listen to people
- don't micromanage
- own your mistakes
- view your successes in the team's overall success
- in conversations with people, esp. difficult conversations, only talk about the things that you've observed and your feelings and reactions to them. Don't make assumptions about someone's motivations for their action

give people ownership of some small peice
What are the teams values? Results, communication, attention to detail

> Teamwork requires coordination and communication, plus a good sense of what to expect, a good understanding of why things are, or are not, happening.
