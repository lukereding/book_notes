# Giving feedback

Remember through all this, as uncomfortable as it may be in some cases, that feedback is a form of caring about someone else.

## Start with a micro-yes

It's useful to start with a question that your direct can say 'yes' to. For example, 'Wilma, can we chat for a minute about the last PR you submitted?' This helps ensure the person doesn't feel ambushed and starts things off on a positive note.

## Feedback should be _actionable_

If the feedback receiver can't act on the feedback, it is not useful feedback. If you give feedback, but the behaviors fail to change, chances are your feedback isn't actionable. Which brings us to:

## Feedback comments on behaviors, not innate traits

The feedback receiver cannot change who they are. People are complex, multifaceted, messy. This is what makes us interesting and what makes some people excel at some tasks where others would struggle. It's important to recognize that people's differences are a source of strength and not to give feedback about these innate differences.

Instead, feedback should be directed at _behaviors_ that a person presumably has the power to modify; otherwise the feedback is not _actionable_.

## Use positive intent and belonging cues

Receiving feedback can be an emotional experience that can ignite all sorts of nasty questions in our heads (Am I good enough? Do I belong here?). Belonging cues help make sure the receiver of the feedback knows he or she belongs, is valued.

When giving feedback, 'aim to assist'. The goal of feedback is for someone to be able to improve, do better work. If you find yourself giving feedback just to bolster your own ego or position, stop giving feedback until you work on yourself.

## Use specific examples

Saying 'X has an opportunity to improve their coding' is not specific enough. It can't direct someone to specific actions they can take to remediate the problem. Give specific examples of when code was poor quality, explain why it was poor quality, and specific steps for the person to consider to improve in this area.

## Explain the impact

There are many potential impacts you can talk about:

- impact it had on other team members
- impact it has on you (see below)
- impact it has on the person (e.g., their promotion prospects)

In the past I've made the mistake of only focusing on the external effects, but in some cases, that's not particularly motivating to people. In those cases, focusing on the impact to something that the person cares about (e.g., their bonus or their promotion readiness) is more useful.

## (sometimes) Explain how it impacted you

There are a couple reasons for doing this. First, it forces people to recognize that their actions impact other people. Second, you're stating something that the receiver of feedback can't argue with: this is private information you're sharing, and if you're saying it, they have to take your word for it.

Consider. I could say, "The team wasted two sprints because you didn't give clear guidance about the spec." If I'm receiving that feedback, I'll get defensive immediately. I can argue "no one else on the team told me that". Instead, if you said, "I felt you didn't give enough guidance about the spec. As a result, I felt disoriented and like I didn't have the context I needed to do my job well." No one can argue with that--it's just how you felt as a result of this person's action. I think this tactic can be used to short-circuit and defensively and turn the conversation into more of a learning, curiosity-based discussion.

## Reinforce positive behaviors 6x more than negative behaviors

This advice comes from _the successful manager_. The idea here is

- this trains your directs not to bristle when you give them feedback
- it keeps them motivated

The risk is for employees who are underperforming or performing well, giving them way more positive than negative feedback might give them the impression that they're doing a stellar job when they aren't.

Still, I think too many conversations of feedback are focused on the negative, and this bit of advice reminds us of the power of positive reinforcement.

## You aren't giving feedback often enough

Make feedback part of ongoing 10/10s. You constantly need to be observing your directs, and, good or bad, writing notes about what they did well or what they could do better, wrapping those observations and next steps in the SBIS framework below, and relaying these to your directs regularly.

Task-based vs. more soft skills, career-focused feedback

## Practical recipes

### Recipe 1

A good general recipe for both positive and negative feedback is the SBIS framework:

- Situation | Give background / context
- Behavior | Describe the behavior (positive or negative)
- Impact | Explain the impact that behavior had
- Solution | Make it actionable, suggest some next steps (or ask an open-ended question and solution together)

If you're working with a direct report, you can ask them

- to parrot it back to you to (to make sure they understand)
- whether the feedback resonates with them

You need to check in with your direct to make sure they've gotten the message and understand what you're trying to communicate.

### Recipe 2

It's often better to simply ask an open-ended question: "How do you think that meeting went?" There are a couple reasons why this is useful. First, it gives you, the manager, data on how self-aware your direct is. Second, it helps your direct build the muscle of reflecting on what happened. And third, often the direct will see the problem and start solving it themselves. All three of these things promote independence and autonomy, which is how you evolve your team and your people.

### Recipe 3 (negative feedback)

For delivering negative feedback, one recipe is:

> When I [heard/observed/reflected on] your [action/behavior/output], I felt concerned because . . . I’d like to understand your perspective and talk about how we can resolve this.

Notice that this recipe, which comes from _Making of a manager_, captures all the components of SBIS.

### Other feedback models

For all their emphasis on candor and feedback, the Netflix 4A feedback model is a bit lacking IMO: the two aspects of their model for giving feedback are 'aim to assist' and 'make it actionable'. This reinforces the need to make feedback _actionable_ ; if you follow this, you will never get into the trap of giving someone feedback about some innate trait they cannot change.

The 4A framework does, however, emphasize the need to train directs to _receive_ feedback well to ensure that feedback is stitched into the culture of the team or company.
