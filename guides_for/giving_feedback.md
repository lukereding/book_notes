# Giving feedback

Remember through all this that feedback is a form of caring about someone else.

### Feedback should be _actionable_

If the feedback receiver can't act on the feedback, it is not useful feedback. Which brings us to:

### Feedback comments on behaviors, not innate traits

The feedback receiver cannot change who they are. People are complex, multifaceted, messy. This is what makes us interesting and what makes some people excel at some tasks where others would struggle. It's important to recognize that people's differences are a source of strength and not to give feedback about these innate differences.

Instead, feedback should be directed at _behaviors_ that a person presumably has the power to modify; otherwise the feedback is not _actionable_.

### Use positive intent and belonging cues

Receiving feedback can be an emotional experience that can ignite all sorts of nasty questions in our heads (Am I good enough? Do I belong here?). Belonging cues help make sure the receiver of the feedback knows he or she belongs, is valued.

When giving feedback, 'aim to assist'. The goal of feedback is for someone to be able to improve, do better work. If you find yourself giving feedback just to bolster your own ego or position, stop giving feedback until you work on yourself.

### Use specific examples

### Explain the effect it has on you

There are a couple reasons for doing this. First, it forces people to recognize that their actions impact other people. Second, you're stating something that the receiver of feedback can't argue with: this is private information you're sharing, and if you're saying it, they have to take your word for it.

Consider. I could say, "The team wasted two sprints because you didn't give clear guidance about the spec." If I'm receiving that feedback, I'll get defensive immediately. I can argue "no one else on the team told me that". Instead, if you said, "I felt you didn't give enough guidance about the spec. As a result, I felt disoriented and like I didn't have the context I needed to do my job well." No one can argue with that--it's just how you felt as a result of this person's action. I think this tactic can be used to short-circuit and defensively and turn the conversation into more of a learning, curiosity-based discussion.


Structure I've used:
- this is something you did that happened
- this was the result
- this was how it made me feel
