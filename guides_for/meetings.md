# guide for meetings

General notes and advice on scheduling, leading, and ensuring work gets done in meetings.

Most of these can be summarized by:

- Be focused.
- Be clear about expectations.


## before the meeting

### the meeting title should reflect the result you want to achieve

You call a meeting for a reason: to do something. It should be really clear what that something is: make a decision, uncover blind spots, divide up work, etc. It should be clear from the meeting title alone what the purpose of the meeting is and what you want to walk away from the meeting with. A meeting title such as, "Discuss database design" or "Walk through X" doesn't tell participants what the goal of the meeting is.

### only invite necessary participants

Identify only the people you need to achieve the goal of the meeting and invite only those people. If the goal of the meeting is clear, participants should never be 'optional': they're either required or not. For each additional person added to a meeting over seven people, effectiveness decision-making decreases by ~10%.

### don't allocate too much time

Tasks expand to the time allocated to them. Be respectful of people's time. Don't schedule a meeting for an hour when you think it should take 30 or 40 min. 

### be clear about the purpose of the meeting and the goal of the meeting

What does the meeting need to accomplish to be successful? Is there anyone that's on-point for presenting or leading parts of the discussion? If so make it clear.

### prepare

Many meetings fail because don't prepare ahead of time. If you're supposed to be leading the meeting, it addition to thinking about the goals and objectives in the meeting, think ahead about if there are specific viewpoints you want to hear or more detailed questions you want answered. Write them down ahead of time to get them out of your head.

## during the meeting

### set the context, define the objectives

When leading a meeting, start out by setting the context then cripsly articulate the objectives of the meeting.

### make sure everyone talks

If someone is in the meeting, it means they're necessary and important for the meeting. They should talk at least once. Ensuring everyone talks also ensures that some meeting partcipants aren't dominating thee conversation and makes the meeting more balanced.

### ensure more than one viewpoint is raised

You want to ensure that people feel comfortable disagreeing and raising different viewpoints. If everyone is just going to agree with each other, there's probably not a reason for you to have the meeting in the first place. Getting people to speak up about what they really feel is more effective than getting someone to play devil's advocate. The leader or most senior person in the room should make it clear that theres in one opinion among many.

### shared knowledge vs. unique knowledge

The two points above are related to the idea of shared vs. unique knowledge. Part of the goal of the meeting is to bring up unique knowledge--things that only one or two people know--to the larger group. If the meeting only touched on shared knowledge--the stuff that everyone already knows--the meeting is useless. Making sure everyone talks and that multiple viewpoints are raised ensures that unique knowledge has a greater likelihood of surfacing. Ask open-ended, as opposed to closed, questions to make sure that people are not just answering with 'yes' and 'no'. Open-ended questions can help raise 'unknown unknowns'.

### time management and focus

The leader of the meeting should be vigilant about making sure partcipants are participating in such a way that the meeting is constantly moving towards the intended goal of the meeting. When participants get hung up on details or side-tracked, it's important that the meeting leader rein them back in.

### before the meeting ends:

#### 1. summarize the meeting

Often, over the course of the discussion, people can get confused over what was actually decided during the meeting. You really don't want everyone in the meeting leaving with different ideas about what happened. So before the meeting ends, summarized what happened or what you decided. What's the takeaway from the meeting? Say it and/or write it down so that it's clear to everyone. Then:

#### 2. identify the DRI for each action item

At the end of the meeting, you probably have some follow-ups or next steps. The person running the meeting should be keeping track of these. At the end of the meeting, the person running the meeting should: (1) restate what the action items are and (2) ensure that each has been tagged _to a specific person_ to get done.

Even in cases where the next steps have been made explicit at the end of the meeting, I've rarely seen a specific person been assigned each action item. Listing the action items without identifying who is accountable is pointless. It creates uncertainty and in my most results in work not getting done.

The idea of a DRI (directly responsible individual) comes from Apple but the same idea can be seen in other companies under different names or concepts.



## after the meeting

### remind everyone what was decided and what the action items are

At the places I've worked, this is pretty rare, but putting a short summary and next steps in writing is, I think, very important. It ensures everything has a permanent reference they can refer to and again, makes sure they everyone in the meeting has the same idea about what was decided or discussed during the meeting. The summary can be sent to others for their awareness who were not necessary for the meeting.
