Figuring out what to build and why.

## general method

To figure out how to design something new or an improvement of an existing product.

Based on the CIRCLES method from Lin.

- Comprehend the situation
  - Context: what is it? who is it for? why do they need it? how does it work?
  - Goals and metrics: drive engagement? revenue? something else?
  - constraints: deadlines, resources, scalability, platform, etc
- Identify the customer
  - Identify a new personas. pick one and run with it
- Report the customer's needs
  - Often useful to use the story template _As a <role>, I want to <goal> so that <benefit>_.
- Cut, through prioritization
  - Evaluate the different goals / needs you could address
  - RICE framework: reach * impact * confidence / effort
- List solutions
  - brainstorm -- come up with a lot of these. can try the reversal method, or challenge the status quo
- Evaluate trade-offs
- Summarize the recommendation
  - this is what I recommend
  - these are details about the recommendation and why it solves a problem
  - these are other alternative solutions that were weaker
  - next steps to explore the idea further
