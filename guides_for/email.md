# How to send a good email

If you spend half an hour each day writing email, over the course of your working career you'll likely spend over 600 full work days writing email. We should make those days count by making sure that the emails we write are effective and to-the-point.

1. Write as little email as possible. Only include the relevant information. You know who's receiving the email you're sending and you can tailor the information based on what those people know and don't know, and what they do and don't care about. Don't include extra information.

2. If an action is needed, make it clear and give a deadline. Bold it and make it hard to miss. Someone should be able to skim the email and know whether they are impacted by the information, if they need to do something, and if so, by when. 

3. All the information should be in the first line or two. Follow the newspaper approach: the headline contains to high-level information; the further into the article the more details there are. Someone should be able to read the first couple lines and know whether they need to keep reading or not. Your email should be easy to skim.

4. Avoid play-by-plays. Resist the urge to spell out how a decision was made, e.g. That's what meetings and meeting notes are for. This rule follows from (1) and (3). 

5. If you have to give gritty details, make them optional and put them below your signature. That way people are clear that the extra information is truly optional and supplementary, and by reading everything above the signature they aren't missing anything truly important. Putting it above the signature can make a reader weary when they initially open your email ("I don't have time to read this now"). 

6. Use bullets and headings for longer emails. If you're writing a longer email, it's mandatory to include a summary at the top that answers the relevant who/what/when/where/why/how questions + what action (if any) you're requesting and a deadline.
