# projects

My running list of various things to keep in mind while managing projects.

### what problem are you trying to solve and what does success look like?

I've found that often people are all too happy to start a new project--maybe they just got a promotion or someone's budget was increased--without clearly knowing what they want out of it. The simplest things are often the hardest to pin down, in this case: what's the problem we're trying to solve? Seems very simple, but I've been on many projects where the goal of the project is assumed, or its never codified and is allowed to bend and warp over time. Such situations can't lead to success because no one knows what success looks like.

It's crucial that everyone know at the start of the project what success looks like. This might be a hard requirement--increase profits by 10%--or it could be a softer requirement, but it should be something that can at least be _measureable_. 

### things will take longer than you think they will

Hofstadter's law; principle of multiplying estimates by 2-3 to get at a more reasonable estimate of timing

### allocate roughly equal time to design, implementation, and testing for tech products

### do experiments and create prototypes

If you use the design time of your project in purely theoretical matters, when it comes time for implementation, you're taking a big risk. You are betting on the certainty of a solution that hasn't been tested or prototyped. You need to prototype to test your assumptions and figure out what you don't know. These prototypes should be quick, cheap, and give you the freedom to fail early and often.

Prototypes have another advantage. Often folks don't really know if a given solution would really solve their problems; it's hard to think abstractly about something that doesn't exist. Prototypes allow you to show a customer would the end solution would look like to a very rough approximation. Even though the fidelity of the prototype is poor, it can still go a long way to illustrating what the end result will look like and make sure you're on the right track. Additionally, by building the prototype, you'll uncover scores of issues you wouldn't have realized were issues if you hadn't created the prototype.

### identify dependencies early on

### have a clear timeline and concrete deliverables

### work to unearth and mitigate risks

### make a strategy document

### understand the end consumers

Understand how the product is used. Ask the end users questions but do not simply do what they tell you to do. You want to understand the users __goals__ and their __latent needs__, not just the goals or products or features they _think_ they need.

### why projects fail

This (rough) list was presented to us during TVL; I thought it's inclusion here was useful:

- not enough time is spent on planing up front
- the client / customer / stakeholder doesn't get back to you
- team members have different ideas about how to accomplish a task
- work is not appropriately distributed
- the team leader doesn't get updates from team members
- scope is not clearly defined
- outcome is not clearly defined
