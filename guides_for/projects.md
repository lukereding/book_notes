# projects

My running list of various things to keep in mind while managing projects.

### what problem are you trying to solve and what does success look like?

I've found that often people are all too happy to start a new project--maybe they just got a promotion or someone's budget was increased--without clearly knowing what they want out of it. The simplest things are often the hardest to pin down, in this case: what's the problem we're trying to solve? Seems very simple, but I've been on many projects where the goal of the project is assumed, or its never codified and is allowed to bend and warp over time. Such situations can't lead to success because no one knows what success looks like.

It's crucial that everyone know at the start of the project what success looks like. This might be a hard requirement--increase profits by 10%--or it could be a softer requirement, but it should be something that can at least be _measureable_. 

### identify dependencies early on

### have a clear timeline

### work to unearth and mitigate risks

### make a strategy document

### understand the end consumers

Understand how the product is used. Ask the end users questions but do not simply do what they tell you to do. You want to understand the users __goals__ and their __latent needs__, not just the goals or products or features they _think_ they need.
