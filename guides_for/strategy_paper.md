# Crafting a strategy paper

This document outlines some common approaches to pulling together a strategy document on a project. Below I outline the core commonalities I found; below that are individual guidelines from various books I've come across.

## Commonalities

- Strategies should be short and clarifying. They should make it clear to someone what you're doing, why, and how you'll know you've done it
- Strategies should have a one-liner with a clear statement of purpose.
- Strategies should articulate the problem and the general approach you're taking to solving the problem
- Strategies should give the high-level statement of work and key deliverables
- Strategies should define and illuminate a positive version of the future
- Strategies should answer core questions like:
  - Who is the customer?
  - What are the measures of success?
  - What's the scope / constraints of the project?
  - How are we mitigating key risks?
  - How does the project align with organizational goals?


## Advice from individual books

### Project statement | RUF

Captures the _why_, _what_, and _when_ of the project. It should be short--no more than three pages (but IMO that's too long). 

Five parts:

- One-liner
- Target customer
- Measures of success -- should be specific and measurable
- Business measures -- ROI, revenue, key business results
- Components -- big blocks of work to be delivered

### Strategy doc | An elegant puzzle

Recommends specific actions to be taken to tackle a problem. Defines a strategy using the structure:

- Diagnosis (what's the problem). It should be specific give the shape of the constraints of the problem.
- Policies (broadly, how are we going to solve it, tradeoffs we'll make). If you read this section and it's not controversial, it's probably bad a bad policy because you likely aren't making any tradeoffs. Tradeoffs take a stance; they might annoy some people. 
- Actions (what are the specific actions we'll take). These follow from the two above.

### Vision doc | An elegant puzzle

_Visions_ are separate and more aspirational / less practical than strategy documents.

Components:

- A 1-2 sentence aspirational statement 
- Value proposition
- Capabilities
- Solved constraints. These are limiting today, but won't be in the future
- Future constraints. Constraints you expect to encounter in the future.
- Reference materials


### Vision doc | Making things happen

Qualities of visions:

- Simplifying. It should give answers to key questions, e.g., and establish contraints.
- Consolidated. Separate out the rationale why from from the goals and directives
- Inspirational
- Memorable
- Intentional / goal-driven

Additionally, visions should be _visual_. Even for abstract problems, people should be able to visualize something that's unlocked or made possible by what you're doing.

Some key points to cover:

- one-sentence articulation of what this project does
- how does this project contribute to the organization's goals?
- what scenarios / features are both (1) essential and (2) desired for the product?
- who are the customers?
- who are the stakeholders
- why will customers buy this thing
- who are the competitors
- how is this not a technology in search of a problem?
- what is out of scope?
- what are some likely reasons this project will fail, and how are those risks being minimized?
- are there other parts of the company that are depending on this project?
- should be as concise as possible
- should be authored by a single person, not by committee
