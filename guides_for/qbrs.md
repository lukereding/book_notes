# QBRs

This is nominally about quarterly business reports (QBRs), but it's really about any kind of business reporting you have to do.

There are a couple features of this sort of reporting:

- the people to which you're communicating often have low context
- the often care about numbers that facilitate comparisons across different areas
- they need to be shown that the business is being managed effectively

## rough notes

I recently reviewed a QBR doc that someone leading a vertical at a publicly traded technology company put together. A certain VP of technology had a lot to say about the QBR doc. I've attempted to distill this person's feedback their main points:

- If you say something is going poorly, always say what you're doing about. Saying something isn't going well invites the question into the audience's mind (why? what actions are we taking?) that you need to answer without them having to ask
- If you're going to quote a number or metric, is it one of the core metrics you use to manage the business? If it isn't, should it be? If you find yourself quoting a metric over and over, but it's not one of the output metrics you're using to manage the business, then maybe it's a sign that you're not managing to the right metrics
- QBRs are meant are quarterly reviews. You should review the quarter. That means citing quarter-over-quarter changes in metrics
- Always reference your goals. If you're doing work that doesn't map to a top-goal level, ask yourself why you're doing the work, or if you need to revise your goals
- Be precise and concrete. Never say 'cut OpEx;' say 'reduce OpEx from X by Y in by ...' Don't say 'a meaningful number;' tell us how many is meaningful.
- A good formula is: metric - definition - from X to Y (% change) - reason why - action
- Everything needs a why
