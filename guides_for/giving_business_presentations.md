# Giving business presentations

## The focus is generally on your slides, not you

- slideuments
- slides get passed around without your voiceover

## Use a framework to build a narrative arc

See [here](../models_for/writing.md#story-telling-and-narrative-tension))

## Write a series of declarative statements to support your narrative arc

- do this outside of PPT
- this becomes the title slides of your talk

## Ensure that the content of each slide supports the title

## One graph per slide

- callouts are good for analolies

## It's still a good idea to say people's names

- give credit when showing other people's work
- if someone contributed meaninfully, say their name

## Spoil the ending: add an executive summary (but add it last)


## Voiceover
