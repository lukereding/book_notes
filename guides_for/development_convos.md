# development convos

Development convos are one tool I use when managing, but I usually struggle with them as a manager. This doc is meant to serve as an means to think more deeply about dev conversions to improve how I use them.

## why development convos?

I think it's important to a regular space with your direct where you step back and specifically do not focus on tactical of everyday work. Development conversations are the core space I reserve for this purposes.

Development conversions are a time where managers and directs can

- talk frankly about career progression
- discuss progress against long- / mid-term goals
- get to know each other better
- level-set on expectations
- provide feedback to one another
- generally check in about how things are going
- share more general context about the company or trends outside the company

## my typical structure

I tell my directs that these are their meetings and they can structure them as they wish. In reality, 'development conversation' is sufficiently nebulous and few people end up taking initiative to shape things according to what they want or need.

MY go-to structure tends to look like:

- General check-in
- Feedback
- Goal check-in

I might first start with a general 'vibe check.' Vibe checks are generally unhelpful unless you ask the right questions to elicit interesting answers, however.

The feedback time is a space for me to share any observations I have about performance or general performance tracking. If someone is working on some aspect of their work specifically, I usually comment on whether what I've observed represents an improvement or not, and ask them how they feel like they've been progressing. Tying these back to previous discussions of ways they want to improve, or feedback from a previous performance management cycle, can be useful.

I develop quarterly goals with my directs to make sure we're on the same page about priorities and to make expectations really clear. It's useful to check in on how we're progressing on a monthly basis against these goals at least.

I structure goals like this:

- outcome goals. 1-2 per quarter. things that drive business value but probably have hard dependencies on other teams and aren't totally within your control
- process goals. 2-4 per quarter. things that contribute to outcome goals, but are totally within your control
- development goals. 1-3 per quarter. things that help you remediate skillset gaps, get better at a specific skill, improve a soft skills, or stretch in some way. these are highly dependent on the person and their long-term goals. I think of these as contributing to the direct's goal of 'getting where they want to go' long term. this is a very important category of goals! it's an important signal that you're investing in your direct and are dedicated to helping them improve.

Other good uses of this time:

- Calibrating good vs. great behavior.
- Directional reads on ratings, if you had to give a rating today
- Where applicable, think about next-level opportunities or actions they can take to become better or more influential.
