# great 1 on 1s

### progress

- celebrate small wins. it's important to note when things are going well and progress is being made, even if at times it's slow
- give ongoing, skill based feedback. for doing this well, see [here](./giving_feedback.md)
- refer back to the goals. you should have goals for each person on your team! 1-1s are a great place to check in on these. see [here](./development_convos.md)

### meaning

- ask what they find most meaningful in their work. this is useful to understand their value's and also to connect their work to a deeper purpose
- link their work back to the mission or vision
- share impact statements and remind people why what they are doing matters

### autonomy

- check in on autonomy levels. people have preferences and needs for autonomy. if you're trying to get someone to become more independent, check in on how they're feeling. do you need to support more? do you need to talk about how to approach a situation in a more general way (so that they can solve the problem themselves next time?)
- explore ways to reduce or increase autonomy, depending on the needs of the person
- give ownership

### social inclusion

- small talk isn't small. it serves an important purpose: by sharing a little something about ourselves, we feel more connected to each other and can see each other as humans and not just as people who work together
- build network.s this is an important one, especially for more junior people. making sure they're connected to the right people and have a network to draw from when they need help, when they have a personal issue, etc. is very important. most junior folks don't do this proactively, and you'll need to encourage them to build out a broader network

### certainty

- create rituals
- have consistent 1:1s. don't cancel and limit rescheduling
- keep a shared document and write down topics ahead of time. take notes during the 1:1
- clarify expectations

### coaching 

this is specifically for helping people work through problems. as a manager, you want people to become less dependent on you and figure things out of their own. problem solving can be difficult though. I find that there are a couple approaches that you can use.

1. explain your reasoning

you'll make decisions or problem-solve in your own work as a manager. when you do, you'll share the result with your team where it makes sense. when I do this, I outline _how_ I came to a particular decision. ideally, I start with a general framework I use when encountering a situation like the one I faced, then I walk through how I applied the framework to get at my decision. or maybe instead of a full framework, I talk about how I think about navigating a particular set of tradeoffs. the idea here is to invite them to share in your thought process so that they can then emulate it in a similar way the next time they make a decision.

2. use the delta method or SOON

when a direct comes to you with a problem, you should resist the urge to solve it or tell them the answer. even if it's really obvious! this is a learning opportunity for your direct and you shouldn't deprive them of it. 

to help them solve it, there are a couple frameworks you can keep in mind. the first is SOON: success, obstacles, options, next steps. A similar, more general approach is the delta method, which asks:

- where are you now?
- where do you want to be?
- how should you bridge the gap between the two?

both frameworks invite your coachee to think about what result they want to bring about and help mobilize action to get there. SOON is a bit more explicit about _how_ to get there: think about what challenges you're going to face, and based on those, articulate a set of possible options. the next step is important. the next step should be something small but something the person can immediately do following the discussion to get started on tackling the problem

importantly: you want to ask open-ended questions while coaching. "do you think early stopping would be useful to try here" when their model is overfitting is not really coaching: it's you telling them to use early stopping. instead, try, "it looks like you're model is overfitting. what are some techniques that can help combat overfitting?"

some examples of questions to ask:

- success
  - what does success look like?
  - what decisions need to be made?
  - what would be the benefit?
  - how should we think about this?
- obstacles
  - what's holding you back?
  - what are your hesitations?
  - what might get in your way?
  - what are the pros or cons of starting sooner?
- options
  - what are the options?
  - what have you tried so far?
  - what other angles could you think of?
  - how else could someone handle this?
  - if you could do anything, what would you do?
- next steps?
  - what's the action plan?
  - what's your next step?
  - what's the first small step you can take?

### receipe

a 'recipe' that I've found useful in the past:

- keep a shared google doc that either person updates prior to the meeting
- ideally, the direct can share progress reports (what happened recently) and blockers / risks on that sheet. the manager can review adn ask questions if needed, but it often won't be needed
- the manager shares their thoughts / concerns / context on the doc ahead of time
- during the meeting:
  - check-in / catch up. ask what they did over the weekend. see how they're feeling overall about work
  - go through the stuff they want to go through. ideally this is not project status. giving status updates in realtime is very low bandwidth and low leverage for this meeting. ideally, the direct focuses on problems they have, blockers, concerns, or other topics that benefit from synchronous communication
  - go through the manager's list of stuff. this might look like:
    - see how they're feeling overall. check in on work/life balance if things have been busy lately. ask how they're feeling about the reorg
    - ask if you can share observations and feedback from the past week. follow the advise [here](./giving_feedback.md)
    - share any questions you have about their projects or work recently that hasn't been covered via other forums
    - provide context and let them know what's top of mind for you: what you're concerned about, what's keeping you up, etc. obviously in some cases you can't share everything. but you can be as transparent as possible about things that are concerning you. as a direct report, I find this sort of information super useful

### other 

- talkbacks / playbacks. to make sure you're following what someone is saying, you could use a _talkback_: summarize what they said in your own words. this can be annoying is done constantly, but it lets them know you're listening and helps you ensure that you're really understanding what they're saying
- split tracks. when someone hits you with a lot of information, you should split-track it: "So what I heard is that the project is off-schedule, you need a new access to finish your work, and you're concerned about the performance review process. can we talk about the project status first?" basically, your direct might not be structured in their communication, and the split-track allows you to impose some structure so that you just have to think about one thing at a time.
