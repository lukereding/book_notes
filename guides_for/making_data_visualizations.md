Main documentation [here](https://github.com/lukereding/thoughts_on_graphics/blob/master/thoughts_on_graphs_and_graphics.md), but outdated and should be updated with

- the function of a figure
- color recommendations
- review recommended figure types for plotting each type of relationship

Or just read Claus' book.
