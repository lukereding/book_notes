# Onboarding

## Introduce the team and org structure

- Introduce the team - who are they, their backgrounds, what they work on, etc.
- Introduce the org structure, common terms used to describe the org structure, how to learn more about it, etc.
- Communicate the vision (what future we're building towards) and our key challenges

## Make expectations clear

- What you think you reasonable for the person to accomplish in 30, 60, and 90 days
- How to work with others
- Esp early on, when you're stuck, as for help: keep a low bar for communication
## Clear barriers

- Identify all accesses they need to do their job
- Identify all documentation they should be aware of
  - Company-specific and norms
  - Team-specific and norms
- Are their common repositories or codebases they can read? They should be aware of these as well.
- Set up weekly 10/10s and monthly development conversations
- Add to all relevant Slack channels

## Establish tone and report early on

- My style
  - Hold you to a high standard
  - They need to give feedback on me _to_ me to better help them
  - Raise risks early and let me clear things out of your way so you can focus on solving problems
  - Early on, I'm more hands-on until you gain confidence and mastery and I trust your judgement
  - In general, you should feel empowered to make decisions, but those decisions need to be transparent: I need to understand how you made a decision, what processes you used, what data and perspectives you considered to gain trust. I need to be able to explain it to someone else easily.
  - How I like to be contacted
- I view my role as
  - showing you what success looks like adn ensuring you understand our goals 
  - supporting you and your development
  - improving processes

## Ensure continuing support and career development

- Given what they'll be working on, can you identify at least 2-3 feedback providers?
- Can you identify a mentor for the employee, someone else more senior they can go to for questions or additional context?
- How like like to be praised / how they like to be managed
- Who was the best manager they had and why?
- What are their talents? What do they do naturally or find satisfying?
- What are their long-term goals?
- How do they like to structure their 10/10s?
