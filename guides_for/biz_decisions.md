# a framework for making decisions in buisness


## use NPV

use discounted future cashflows as a criteria. helps prevent short-term thinking. provides a natural way (the discount rate) to incorporate the relative riskiness of different types of decisions. e.g., you might require a higher discount rate for a new program, but a lower one for a change to an established business that is relatively proven out

## identify all assumptions and sources of uncertainty

e.g., the economy tomorrow will be similar to the economy today
the estimate we derived from limited data is correct

## label by likelihood and severity

e.g., it's possible that the estimate we derived is from limited data is wrong. does it matter? in some cases, the outcome is fairly resilient to that number, so it ends up not really mattering all that much

## do a sensitivity analysis

change the inputs. how do the outputs change?

## develop risks and mitigations for each

a mitigation might be 'monitor'. it might be 'accept the risk'. it might be 'start with a tiny population and work up over time'.

the alternative to this is to try to get 'the right answer'. but the right answer is typically not really knowable because the world is so complex, and you will never have all the information you need. so instead, to feel good about the actions you're taking, you need to account for the fact that things might not go the way you think they will. that means putting in place mitigations or plans when those unknowns manifest.

## bonus: monte carlo

I'm a little torn about this one. for simple decisions where the outcome depends on known dynamics and the core problem is that you have crappy estimates, monte carlo analysis is great. for really complex decisions, or when your depend on a world that is stochastic and different to predict and subject to a million forces you could never model directly, I think this probably leads to a sense of false precision.

__remember:__ the outcome is influenced by the stochasticity of the world. the decision is all within your control. good outcomes can come from bad decision processes and vice versa. focus on the decision process.
