> A manager's job is to _get better outcomes from a group of people working together_ through influencing purpose, people, and process.

\- The making of a manager

Overall, a good idea to anchor to: try to be the sort of manager who, if you were to leave your company, your direct reports would follow you to your new job.

## your job as a manager

Your job is to _get better outcomes from a group of people working together_.

Some things to focus on:

1. Build a high-functioning team (people)
2. Support direct reports in career goals (people)
3. Create processes to get things done smoothly (process)
4. Provide context and show what success looks like (purpose)

Processes are not roadblocks: they are [expectations made explicit](https://klinger.io/posts/managing-people-ðŸ¤¯).

## think about these questions

These come from Gallup, and in general, I think they are a useful starting point for ensuring your direct reports are reasonably happy:

  - I know what is expected of me at work
  - I have the right materials and equipment to do my job
  - I have opportunity to do what I do best every day
  - In the last 7 days, I've received recognition or praise for doing good work
  - Someone at works cares about me as a person
  - There is someone at work who encourages my development

You want to get 5/5 on each of these questions.

## building trust

- Respect and care about your direct reports (_managing is caring_)
- Invest time in your people
- Be transparent about performance
- Admit your own mistakes and areas for growth

## questions to ask your direct reports

- Is there something I could do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?
- What did you and your past manager discuss that was most helpful to you?
- What are the ways in which youâ€™d like to be supported?
- How do you like to be recognized for great work?
- What kind of feedback is most useful for you?
- Imagine that you and I had an amazing relationship. What would that look like?

## play to strengths

Good managers play to the strengths of their direct reports--their talents, those things they do naturally. Think carefully about your direct reports talents and how you can put the employee in a situation where everyone benefits from that talent.

When I was very green and interned at Continuum, my takeaway about management was:

> Good management is about setting expectations and letting people do what they're good at

Looking back, this feels a bit naive--there's a lot that goes into managing effectively!--but is also mostly accurate.


## practical recipes and tools

### diagnosing poor results or work output

What gets in the way of good work? (a) People don't know how to do good work or (b) they aren't motivated to do good work. Let's look at each.

**People don't know how to do good work**. There several reasons why this might be. Some things to think about:

- Does their job require talents that they don't have? If so, is there a better role or someone they could pair with the balance them out?
- Does their job require skills that they don't have? If so, think about trainings that could address the skill gap.
- Is it clear what success looks like? Does everyone have a good idea of what great work looks like? If not, make expectations clearer and make sure everyone knows the vision and purpose of your team.

**People aren't motivated to do good work**. Some things to think about here:

- Three components of motivation are autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Are you falling short in not giving them opportunity to master something, or are you micromanaging them?
- Does the role speak to their aspirations and long-term goals? If not, should this person change roles, or take on slightly different scope?
- Do they feel appreciated? Doing good work and not receiving recognition for it can kill anyone's motivation.

### 1:1 recipe

Focus on asking questions and listening during these meetings. Some things to consider during 1:1s:

- Top priorities
- Calibrate what great /success looks like
- Figure out if your direct report is challenged, not challenged enough, bored
- Share feedback
- Zoom out and discuss how things are going overall
- Project status
- Blockers and risks
- Degree of tracking towards long-term goals

Some questions you can ask to get things going:

- What's top of mind for you this week?
- What priorities are you thinking about this week?
- What's the worst-case scenario you're worried about?
- What's the ideal outcome here look like?
- What's hard about getting to that outcome?
- How can I help you?
- What can I do to make you more successful?

### career development conversations

The goal of these conversations is to get to know your direct report a bit more and understand what motivates them. This helps you figure out what types of work / projects make sense for them ensures your direct report remains motivated.

- Start with observations and feedback. See [notes on giving feedback](giving_feedback.md)
- Figure out what motivates your direct report
- Ask about why they moved from their past jobs?
- Jobs as tools we can use to achieve our higher aspirations
- Ask for feedback on yourself

Radical Candor framework:
1. Life story. Ask your DR to tell you about their live since kindergarten. Listen for the changes that people made and what motivated or caused those changes--values often are revealed in moments of change.
2. Dreams. Understand what people want to achieve at the apex of their career, the best life they want to live. "What do you want the pinnacle of your career to look like?" It's okay to have them articulate more than one dream.
3. 18-month plan. Translate what you learned above into concrete actions that you can take to get your DR the skills or experience they need to move in the direction of their dreams.

For each person on your team, you want to answer each of these questions:

- Where is this person going?
- What are you doing to help get them there?

If you could write down a few words that described your direct reports motivations, what would they be (e.g., 'hard work', 'financial independence', 'being an expert', etc.)?

### checklist

- [ ] Are the 3-4 folks who can provide feedback on their work?
- [ ] How do they like to structure their 1:1s?
- [ ] How do they like to receive praise?
- [ ] What are their long-term goals?
- [ ] Do they have a mentor who can help them grow? 


## on being managed

Of course, we're all managed by others. How can this relationship be as great as possible?

<more to come> 

With your own manager, you can ask questions like:

- What does it mean to do a great job versus an average or poor job?
- Can you give me some examples? Can you share your impressions of how you think Project X or Meeting Y went?
- Why do you think that? I noticed that Z happened the other day.Â .Â .Â . Is that normal or should I be concerned?
- What keeps you up at night? Why?
- How do you determine which things to prioritize?
- What are the biggest things holding me back form having greater impact?

A good way to ask for feedback and allow your boss to tell you without him or her coming across poorly is to ask

- What would you have done differently in that meeting/project/engagement?



Fixing problems with your manager: 

  - If your manager is too busy to talk about performance / your goals: you have to tell them it's a priority and make time for it
  - If your manager is telling you _how_ to do everything: tell them you want to define your role more by the outcomes and less by the process. Ask what outcomes you should use to measure success
  - If your manager praises you inappropriately: suggest alternatives to him or her


## antipatterns

- Micromanaging
- Not having enough time to think / brainstorm / read / "you never get anything done around here between 9 and 5"
- The 'Spanish theory' of productivity, aka, just drive people to work harder. Contrast with the 'English theory', where you use tech to make your job easier and create value without burnout
