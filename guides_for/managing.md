Overall, a good idea to anchor to: try the sort of manager who, if you were to leave your company, your direct reports would follow you to your new job.

## your job as a manager

1. Build a high-functioning team (people)
2. Support direct reports in career goals (people)
3. Create processes to get things done smoothly (process)
4. Provide context and show what success looks like (purpose)

## think about these questions

These come from Gallup, and in general, I think they are managable starting point for ensuring your direct reports are reasonably happy:

  - I know what is expected of me at work
  - I have the right materials and equipment to do my job
  - I have opportunity to do what I do best every day
  - In the last 7 days, I've received recognition or praise for doing good work
  - Someone at works cares about me as a person
  - There is someone at work who encourages my development

You want to get 5/5 on each of these questions.

## questions to ask your direct reports

- Is there something I could do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?
- What did you and your past manager discuss that was most helpful to you?
- What are the ways in which youâ€™d like to be supported?
- How do you like to be recognized for great work?
- What kind of feedback is most useful for you?
- Imagine that you and I had an amazing relationship. What would that look like?

## play to strengths

Good managers play to the strengths of their direct reports--their talents, those things they do naturally. Think carefully about your direct reports talents and how you can put the employee in a situation where everyone benefits from that talent.

## 1:1 recipe

Some things to consider during 1:1s:

- Top priorities
- Calibrate what great looks like
- Share feedback
- Project status
- Blockers and risks
- Degree of tracking towards long-term goals

Some questions you can ask to get things going:

- What's top of mind for you this week?
- What priorities are you thinking about this week?
- What's the worst-case scenario you're worried about?
- What's the ideal outcome here look like?
- What's hard about getting to that outcome?
- How can I help you?
- What can I do to make you more successful?

## checklist

- [ ] Are the 3-4 folks who can provide feedback on their work?
- [ ] How do they like to structure their 1:1s?
- [ ] How do they like to receive praise?
- [ ] What are their long-term goals?
- [ ] Do they have a mentor who can help them grow?
