# the manager's path

Camille Fournier

Random takeaways and key points:

- As you get higher up, you have to master not saying 'no' to your boss but 'yes, and': yes i can do that _and_ I'll need three more months or an other tech team
- Good managers know who to 'play the game' at your company
- Good managers care honestly and personally about their direct reports
- Listening is one of the most important skills
- Staying technical even as you move up the management chain is important
- 'Debug' problems on your team like it's a machine or a complex system (which it is)
- Appropriate context enables people to make good decisions
- Understand the difference between things that are urgent and things that are important

## management 101

- Great list of characteristics of a great manager:
  - care about you
  - actively work to help you grow your career
  - give you valuable feedback
  - help you understand what's important to focus on
  - they want you to take their job one day

- Immediate feedback is super important
- 1/1s are important so you and your manager can get to know each other as people

### how to be managed

- Spend some time thinking about what you want
- Ask your managers for advice. It's easier to say, "I have this problem, how would you approach it" than "I have this problem, please fix it for me"


## mentoring

### intern

- In many ways, mentoring is like a sales pitch for the company; if even your intern sucks, you want them to tell their friends about how great it was to work at company X
- Spend some time thinking of your intern project and _break it down into milestones_
- Make sure there's an opportunity for her to present her work at the end
- Listen to what your intern tells you; communication is hard

### new hire

- Onboarding docs are great and a good way that a new hire can contribute (by updating the documentation)
- Make sure you introduce the new person around to other people that will need to know to be effective

## tech lead

- Tech leads still write code, but they are more involved with project management of the work. Includes:
  - System architect
  - Business analyst
  - Project planner
  - Software developer
  - Team leader
- Tech leads strattle the makers/manager schedule; need to find big chunks of time to get actual work done

### managing a project

- When to comes to project management, planning things out ahead of time and communicating are super important. The plan will never come to be but by planning you force yourself to think about the future in a way that you not otherwise
- Think about:
  - What work items can be done in parallel
  - What work items have to be done in series
  - Identify risks and unknowns

1. Break down the work
2. Push through the details. You need to form some kind of a plan even though there will always be some unknowns.
3. Run the project and adjust the plan as you go
4. Use what you learned from (1) to manage changes to requirements 
5. Revisit details as you get close to completion -- there are things you might have to cut to make your deadline

### qualities of a great tech leads

- Understand the architecture
- Be a team player
- Lead tech discussions
- Communicate

## managing people

- You need to ask a lot of questions to understand your direct reports initially, how they operate, what their goals are etc.:
  - How they like to be praised
  - How they like to get feedback
  - What makes them excited
  - What manager behaviors drive them nuts
  - What are their career goals
  - Surprises since they've joined

- You need to be really clear about your expectations and style

- 1/1s are super important
  - generally, want these to be once a week
  - avoid mondays and fridays

- There are different styles of 1/1s:
  - To do list. Can be artificial, handled via email often
  - The catch-up
  - The feedback meeting
  - The progress report
  - Getting to know you

- Advice for delegating effectively:
  - Use the team's goals to understand which details you need to dig into. If you feel like you want to micromanage, ask the team how they're measuring success and ask them to make that visible to you
  - Gather information from other sources (e.g. github) before going to the people
  - Adjust your focus depending on the stage of the project
  - Establish standards for code and systems. Putting these standards in place helps people know what details are important when working
  - Reward the sharing of information, good or bad

- Strive to create a culture of continuous feedback. A lot part of this is getting in the habit of constantly observing people and taking notes on what they're doing well and what they aren't doing well. 

- When discussing potential, she says that 'a person who has never shown reasonable performance, and who has been with the company long enough for you to observe performance, probably doesn't have potential, at least within the company.'

## managing a team

- You need to stay technical. You need to be able to balance the tech against business needs and overall context of the team; you can't do this if you're super disconnected.
- You generally need to give people some context into _why_ certain goals have been set, or _why_ they're working on something, even if it means not totally 'protecting' them from bs. Appropriate context enables people to make good decisions.

### debugging dysfunctional teams

- Not shipping. Are tools processes getting in the way?
- People drama. Nip it in the bud.
- Overwork. 
- Collaborating problems (i.e. with other teams)

### driving good decisions

- create a data-driven team culture -- track number of issues, bugs, etc.
- product -- develop customer empathy
- look into the future -- you need to be thinking two steps ahead
- review the outcome of your decisions
- run retrospectives

### people that can destroy team cohesion

- the brilliant jerk
- the noncommunicator
- the employee who lacks respect

### project management guidelines

- budget 20% of time for tech debt
- assume 10 productive work weeks / quarter
- say 'no' as the deadline approaches
- 'guess and double it' to estimate how long something will take
- be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate -- it can be exhausting. another reason why you need to stay technical

## managing a team

- Managing your time becomes more difficult. Only make time for important things.
- You still want to attend some lower-level meeting, in part to get a sense of how your team is behaving--are they bored, unmotivated, tired?
- It's okay to feel drained when you take on this role; things will improve.
- Delegate simple and frequent tasks; do simple infrequent tasks yourself; carefully delegate complex frequent tasks; delegate complex infrequent tasks for training purposes
- Your goal with the above is that you want your teams to operate really effectively without much input from you
- You'll have to learn how to say 'no' nicely:
  - "yes and" | good pattern to use with highups. "yes i can do and that _and_ I'll need another tech team"
  - create a policy | basically, make it clear what needs to be in place for a 'yes' to happen
  - "help me say yes" | means you ask questions about the things you don't understand
  - appeal to time and budget
  - don't prevaricate
- measuring the health of your team
  - frequency of release. if you aren't releasing frequently, it's a sign that somethings off
  - frequency of code check-ins
  - frequency of incidents
- treat your dysfunctional teams like bugs
  - keep asking _why_ until you get to the root cause of the issue
  - have a hypothesis, and use data as much as you can to determine to degree to which your hypothesis makes sense
  - observe the team--boring meeting can be a sign of dysfunction, as it means there isn't healthy conflict on the team
  - ask questions
  - be curious
- expectations and scheduling
  - be aggressive about sharing estimates and updates to estimates, even when people don't ask

## bootstrapping culture

Some import thoughts on structure and process:

> Pretending to lack structure tends to create hidden power structures resulting from the nature of human communication and the challenges of trying to scale that communication.

> Structure is how we scale, diversify, and take on more complex long-term tasks

Without process, you can't scale. With the wrong process, you'll be slowed down. 

When failures on your team occur, examine all aspects of reality that contribute to those failures

Culture = "unspoken rules of a community"

First, define your culture. What does your team stand for? What does it value? Then reward people that exhibit those traits. 

## managing managers

- The 'open door policy' usually backfires. Few people are going to actually come to you with their problems.
- The goal of skip-level meetings is to gain perspective on the health and focus of your team. You also want to get a sense of how you're being 'managed up' by your direct reports. I.e. they can be useful to identify managers who only want to report good news to you.
- If your managers have unusable roadmaps, bad tech leads, or are constantly fighting fires, _you have to hold your manager responsible_. 

## anti-patterns

- The 'alpha geek'.
  - harmful to collaboration, undermines those who feel unable to fight back
  - alpha geeks often hide information to maintain their edge, which is bad and makes everyone less effective

- The 'process czar', i.e., there is one best way to do something
  - there is no one best process of all teams
  - 'individuals and interactions over processes and tools' (from the agile manifesto)
  - An obsession with process is often related to a fear of failure and a desire for control

- Micromanagement
  - Comes down to trust and control
  - If you make all the decisions for someone, not only do you deprive them of growth, but autonomy is a key element of motivation

- Avoiding conflict
  - No one is going to feel secure or knows what's going to happen next if no one takes responsibility for decisions and sets direction 
  - Don't rely on consensus voting; establish processes to depersonalize decisions

- Focusing on team identity to the exclusion of all else
  - fragile to the loss of the leader
  - resistent to outside ideas
  - inflexible
  - often result in outcomes that, while are good for the team, might be bad for the company

- The people pleaser
  - Struggles to say no and as a result can send contradictory messages to the team and other stakeholders
  - makes it difficult for the team to fail in a healthy way
  - 

## interesting quotations

> the most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of your company

I love how fresh and visual this metaphor is:

> we're constantly pushing complex ideas through the eye of the needle of language

> If one universal talent separates successful leaders from the pack, it's communication skills. Successful leaders write well, they read carefully, and the can get up in front of a group and speak.

Interesting test for a happy team--if you buy them pizza at the end of the day, will they stick around and eat it?

> As a manager of multiple teams, you can win back a lot of time by pushing an efficient meetings culture down to your teams.

> The skills of a manager...are pretty much entirely based around communication.
