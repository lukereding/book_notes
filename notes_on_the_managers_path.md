# the manager's path

Camille Fournier

Random takeaways and key points:

- As you get higher up, you have to master not saying 'no' to your boss but 'yes, and': yes i can do that _and_ I'll need three more months or an other tech team
- Good managers know who to 'play the game' at your company
- Good managers care honestly and personally about their direct reports
- Listening is one of the most important skills


## management 101

- Great list of characteristics of a great manager:
  - care about you
  - actively work to help you grow your career
  - give you valuable feedback
  - help you understand what's important to focus on
  - they want you to take their job one day

- Immediate feedback is super important
- 1/1s are important so you and your manager can get to know each other as people

### how to be managed

- Spend some time thinking about what you want
- Ask your managers for advice. It's easier to say, "I have this problem, how would you approach it" than "I have this problem, please fix it for me"


## mentoring

### intern

- In many ways, mentoring is like a sales pitch for the company; if even your intern sucks, you want them to tell their friends about how great it was to work at company X
- Spend some time thinking of your intern project and _break it down into milestones_
- Make sure there's an opportunity for her to present her work at the end
- Listen to what your intern tells you; communication is hard

### new hire

- Onboarding docs are great and a good way that a new hire can contribute (by updating the documentation)
- Make sure you introduce the new person around to other people that will need to know to be effective

## tech lead

- Tech leads still write code, but they are more involved with project management of the work. Includes:
  - System architect
  - Business analyst
  - Project planner
  - Software developer
  - Team leader
- Tech leads strattle the makers/manager schedule; need to find big chunks of time to get actual work done

### managing a project

- When to comes to project management, planning things out ahead of time and communicating are super important. The plan will never come to be but by planning you force yourself to think about the future in a way that you not otherwise
- Think about:
  - What work items can be done in parallel
  - What work items have to be done in series
  - Identify risks and unknowns

1. Break down the work
2. Push through the details. You need to form some kind of a plan even though there will always be some unknowns.
3. Run the project and adjust the plan as you go
4. Use what you learned from (1) to manage changes to requirements 
5. Revisit details as you get close to completion -- there are things you might have to cut to make your deadline

### qualities of a great tech leads

- Understand the architecture
- Be a team player
- Lead tech discussions
- Communicate

## managing people

- You need to ask a lot of questions to understand your direct reports initially, how they operate, what their goals are etc.:
  - How they like to be praised
  - How they like to get feedback
  - What makes them excited
  - What manager behaviors drive them nuts
  - What are their career goals
  - Surprises since they've joined

- You need to be really clear about your expectations and style

- 1/1s are super important
  - generally, want these to be once a week
  - avoid mondays and fridays

- There are different styles of 1/1s:
  - To do list. Can be artificial, handled via email often
  - The catch-up
  - The feedback meeting
  - The progress report
  - Getting to know you

- Advice for delegating effectively:
  - Use the team's goals to understand which details you need to dig into. If you feel like you want to micromanage, ask the team how they're measuring success and ask them to make that visible to you
  - Gather information from other sources (e.g. github) before going to the people
  - Adjust your focus depending on the stage of the project
  - Establish standards for code and systems. Putting these standards in place helps people know what details are important when working
  - Reward the sharing of information, good or bad

- Strive to create a culture of continuous feedback. A lot part of this is getting in the habit of constantly observing people and taking notes on what they're doing well and what they aren't doing well. 

- When discussing potential, she says that 'a person who has never shown reasonable performance, and who has been with the company long enough for you to observe performance, probably doesn't have potential, at least within the company.'


## anti-patterns

- The 'alpha geek'.
  - harmful to collaboration, undermines those who feel unable to fight back
  - alpha geeks often hide information to maintain their edge, which is bad and makes everyone less effective

- The 'process czar', i.e., there is one best way to do something
  - there is no one best process of all teams
  - 'individuals and interactions over processes and tools' (from the agile manifesto)
  - An obsession with process is often related to a fear of failure and a desire for control

- Micromanagement
  - Comes down to trust and control
  - If you make all the decisions for someone, not only do you deprive them of growth, but autonomy is a key element of motivation

## interesting quotations

> the most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributes to the overall success of your company

I love how fresh and visual this metaphor is:

> we're constantly pushing complex ideas through the eye of the needle of language

> If one universal talent separates successful leaders from the pack, it's communication skills. Successful leaders write well, they read carefully, and the can get up in front of a group and speak.
