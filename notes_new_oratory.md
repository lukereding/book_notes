# the new oratory

Anthony Jay


Minto references this book in _pyramid principle_ so I was intrigued by it. There's a lot of interesting content in here, a lot of which I hadn't seen presented so succinctly before. A lot of the book, however, is focused on giving large (50+ people) presentations, so some of the advice and thinking doesn't quite apply to more intimate presentations.

- "a presentation is an exercise in persuasion"
- "**the presenter takes all the trouble himself to save his audience trouble; he makes things hard for himself so they they may be easy for his audience**"
- "You have to start in the area they understand, you have to identify correctly the assumptions and questions in their minds before you can start to take them with you into unknown territory."
- after each section, think of your listeners minds again what question are reflection will be occupying them now? keep thinking about what the audience is going to be thinking and feeling as you going through the presentation. Jay calls this relating to the audience. 
- you must make sure that the audience sees, not just hears, everything that you want them to remember 
- he argues that you basically have to write out what do you want to say, for three reasons:
  - to keep the visuals on track
  - to keep the time on track
  - so that you can think about the best way to communicate things
- he talks a lot about the **difference between written English and spoken English** and how you want to strive to write spoken English when you’re writing out what you want to say 
- sign posting is more important when speaking out loud because the audience doesn’t know where your ideas stop and start like they do when reading the written word 
- **abstract nouns are the barbiturates of communication: "soporific in small doses and lethal in large ones."**
- analogies are great. They may not provide complete explanations, but they communicate the core point
- he makes some interesting points about how to deal with different levels of knowledge in your audience. One approach is to drop background facts, casually, and offensively to let experts know what you’re talking about but you provide context for neo sites. He suggests that you should never overestimate your audiences knowledge or underestimate their intelligence. 
- words are not visuals!
- Chapter 6 has a lot of good advice on using slides. Some tips:
  - don’t make slides too complex
  - don’t make them too crowded
  - make sure that you explain what’s on your slide; even though it’s familiar to you, it’s not gonna be somebody to someone else
- The success of the smaller presentation can be measured by the amount of time the presenter spends and listening to and answering questions
