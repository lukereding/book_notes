# Do Design: Why beauty is key to everything

Moore

I picked up this book on a whim at Kramers. There's a lot in here I like, though I do think it's a bit sugary and oversimplified throughout.

One of the main ideas I found in the book that resonated with me: good design is life affirming. Good design means giving a damn, realizing you that want to surround yourself with beauty, that you want to life in world with minimal frustration and pain. The example he gives is of the Shakers. They designed like they no no time to live and infinite time simultaneously. They made things that were functional and beautiful and they took pride in making things well. Think about furniture that is poorly designed, or falls apart: what does that say about the designer's view on life? What does it say about yours?

Another idea I like: "people embrace what they create". This comes up in a lot of the books I've read (e.g., multipliers), but isn't so pithily articulated.

There's also a lot in here about the power of visualizing the future, whether that's a more cosmic 'future you want to live in' or how you imagine (free of constraints!) that a user might interact with your product, e.g. The key is not to start from where you are are think about incremental changes: if you take that approach, you often 'can't get there from here.' Focusing on the future and working back from that, and not forward from the present, is generally necessary for truly creative thinking. Connection here to brainstorming / flaring and reserving judgement.

The idea from William Morris that things you have should be either beautiful or useful, which is also the first quote in the next book I picked up (_emotional design_).
