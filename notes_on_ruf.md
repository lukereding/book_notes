## notes for _risk up front_

The ideas in the book were good but I found the organization to be a little haphazard. I think the first two parts of the book could have easily been condensed into one, and the book would have become clearer in the process.

## observations that motivate the approach advocated in the book

The point of the whole book is to make sure risks are identified early on in the process when they're less expensive and can still be fixed. The actions and prescriptions in the book are meant to shift urgency that normally happens towards the end of a project to the beginning of the project. People tend to be optimistic planners: they underestimate how long it takes to get something done. Most projects finish late, not early. People also tend to be optimistic procrastinators: if someone says "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it," they are embodying that idea.

In a RUF project you quantify all the costs of being late. There can be both linear costs (e.g. we'll use $X each month we're late) and non-linear costs (e.g. if we don't deliver on time, the client won't pay for it). Being up-front and precise about the costs of being late also allows you to make smarter decisions about where to spend money to stay on schedule. 

## risks are good

To avoid being late, we need to vocalize risks: things that could happen that impact our ability to deliver. The team needs to be very upfront and vocal about risks. Risks are good. Identifying risks risks allow us to take action to prevent bad things from happening.

When we talk about risks, it's useful to use the CEI form:

- __cause__: an observable fact or condition. this should not be something someone could argue about
- __effect__: a possible future bad outcome
- __impact__: what would matter if the bad thing happened

We address risks in three steps:

1. __identification__. Use the __risk action plan__ to call out risks
2. __prioritization__.
3. __mitigation__. take steps to mitigate the risks

## core principles

- __integrity__. you do what you say
- __accountability__. single ownership of a result. note that just because you're accountable for something, it doesn't mean you have to do the work yourself, you just have to make sure it gets done.
- __transparency__. team-wide clarity of who owns what. this means writing things down.
- __commitment__. you do what you say you're going to do.

## levers to shift culture

I find this to be a bit simplistic, but it's a good starting point:

- __language__. how you talk about things
- __structures__. including how you spend money and resources
- __practices__. repeated or trigger activities or tools
- __metrics__. what you choose to measure

They define the components of culture as (1) results, (2) narrative, and (3) behavior.

## the five axis of a project definition (i.e. the 5Ws)

- __why__. who is this project for?
- __what__. what are we exploring or creating?
- __who__. who's on the team?
- __when__. when will it get done?
- __why not__. what risks are we taking on? what is going to be hard?


## RUF project outline

### commitment phase

Consists of (1) exploring (identifying risks early on, experiment, prototype), (2) making tradeoffs (decide the 5Ws), and (3) deciding (finalize the project statement).

During the __commitment phase__, the team settles on the five-Ws. They do this through developing a __project statement__ that defines the project. This might take awhile and be messy. The goal is to identify all the risks, decide on the scope of the project, and decide what you won't do. The project statement is developed through a series of __definition meetings__. The goal of these meeting to discover what we don't know. 

At the end of the commitment, everyone will agree to the project definition. Importantly, __all the team members that contribute to the project should be present for the commitment phase__. If there are team members that aren't present that figure into the delivery of the result, we can't honestly navigate the 5W tradeoff because there are unknown unknowns that the absent team members could have otherwise raised. 

Over both the delivery and commitment phases, there are __weekly accountability meetings (WAM)__. The goal of the WAM is: (1) Make clear what percent of things were done that week, (2) make sure the tasks for next week still look good, and (3) have each team member what they feel are the two biggest risks for the project. Basically, at the WAM you read through what everyone said they would do and what actually happened. It's important that each action item be really clear and it be obvious when something is or isn't done. 

### delivery phase

Consists of (1) executing and (2) assessing. Actually very little in the book about this, but follows from the meeting structure and tools advocated.

## team structure

1. Project leader. There should be one, not two, people that lead the project.
2. Core team. This might be the head or lead for each discipline that contributes to the project. 
3. Extended team. Everyone else on the team.

## project documents

### project statement

Outlines the 5W tradeoffs. Max. 3 pagers.

1. One liner. 'For X, we will do Y by Z date.'
2. Target customer. Be specific. Useful to distinguish between the primary customer (you will change the product to satisfy this person) vs. the secondary target customer (you won't change the product for this person, but you still are building it for them)
3. Customer measures of success. Bulleted, describe what you're enabling the customer to do. These are measurable. 
4. Business measures of success. Also includes the project end date and the cost of being late.
5. Components. Blocks of what we'll deliver in the project. Enables the customer measures of success. 

### the team list

Document that outlines who is on the team, their role, location, and contact information. 

Along with this, each team member should have an individual accountability document, which outlines

1. the name of the team member
2. status of the document
3. role on the project
4. individual responsibilities. _For this project, you can count on me to..._

### weekly schedule

This is what gets discussed at the WAMs. Spreadsheet with a sheet for each week. Make sure each row / action item is tied to

- the deliverable
- the track / department
- the owner
- the due date
- whether it's done or not
- any notes

### the risk action plan (RAP sheet)

For each risk, list:

- the track / department
- the cause
- the effect
- the impact
- priority
- owner
- a list of proposed mitigations (>=5)

The process for submitting risks should be as low as possible. There will be lots of risks. The submitter of the risk should identify at least two mitigations.


## interesting asides

Whenever reviewing a document, action items, risk, ask the team:

- is it accurate?
- is it clear? (like, _really_ clear)
- does it belong here?

When creating documents, it's useful to label them as

- draft
- final
- current as of [date]

Useful idea: __accountability matrix__. It's a document that outlines who owns what major parts of the project. The columns of the sheet might be the milestones / major parts / decision of the project and the rows are team members. The entries in each cell are either (1) if that person owns that result or (2) if the person is involved in the decision. 

Also: The __project portfolio sheet__. Rows for each project, columns are project name, one-liner, active (y/n), project state, owner, state date, end date, notes.
