# What I learned interning at Continuum


- The motto is 'we get shit done'
- The tolerance for things that don't work is low
- Working on a team doesn't have to hamper your priorities
- Prioritizing is paramount
- Knowing when "good enough" is good enough is a useful skill
- Contributing to a team effort can be highly satisfying, but also can result in lack of ownership
- Communication is key when working with others
- Good management is about setting expectations and letting people do what they're good at
- Being able to get something useful done in 1-5 days feels great
- People respect you if you work hard, are fair, and are honest
- You work with what you're given
- Snacks are weirdly important for morale
