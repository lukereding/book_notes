# A swim in the pond in the rain

Saunders

This is a book about how to read and react to fiction, and also what purpose fiction fulfills, what role it plays in our lives. Saunders talks about the ways that stories work and why those stories that succeed manage to do so.

It was interesting to read this after looking at my notes to Franklins _writing for story_. First, there are similarities. Franklin is much more formulaic--maybe he should be, as he's writing non-fiction--but there are some core commonalities in the advice.

But the approach to the story is very different between the two. (Again, this is likely because Franklin is dealing with non-fiction.) Franklin is very structured and imposes an outline on his stories before he writes--he knows where he's headed as he's writing something. Saunders explicitly calls this sort of thing out as hogwash (he cites a certain Gertrude Stein quotation.) His stories are built a line at a time, meandering, him not knowing where they will take them, letting them have a mind of their own. But he edits like crazy, reading and rereading and noticing what works for him, what doesn't, and that iterative process, working line by line, registering what works and what doesn't, and taking some action--that's the process that produces a George Saunders story.



- Story structure as call and response. The story initiates a question in the reader's mind and the story responds to that question.

- Our minds respond to specific physical descriptions. I.e., be specific and concrete

- Set up an obvious solution, then remove it. The reader has an expectation about where something is headed. Usually, we don't like the solution to be satisfied too neatly, otherwise, the story isn't original. Removing the obvious solution forces you and the story to respond to omission and (hopefully) escalate.

- Every structural unit unit of the story should be both (1) entertaining in its own right and (2) propel the story forward 

- A story should change the character forever, and not just randomly, usually as a product of some experience / struggle the character is put up against.

- "Art doesn't have to solve problems, it just has to formulate them correctly." (I think that was a Tolstoy quotation)

- "An artist is someone who takes responsibility"

- A good story creates a pattern of excesses--things I can't help noticing--then converts them into virtues

- "All art begins in that instant of intuitive preference"

- The iteration is: notice, react, revise. Iteration + intuition

- You work with what you've got to produce something real, something evocative

- A writes sets up some expectation then _responds_ to the expectation, but not too neatly

- _Escalation_ takes an anecdote and makes it into a story

- "In specificity lies nascent plot." (What a line!) The things you reveal about your characters has some bearing on the stories action. 

- The law of efficiency -- for short stories, you have to assume that every action, every image, every plot image is there for a specific reason. The medium is ruthlessly efficient

- Always be escalating 

- "Having an intention and then executing it does not make good art"

- Writing as an act of refining your prescence in a conversation with your reader

- "A fact draws us in."

- The events in a story can't just happen randomly--there has to be a _pattern of causality_--one thing has to _cause_ the next

- "Causation creates the appearance of meaning."

- Grok a voice and run with it--see where it takes you. Write like the only thing you're trying to do is to sustain that voice. Put events in front of the voice. Let the voice respond to the events.

- A story doesn't necessarily tell you how to think about something, but it might tell us how to _approach_ thinking about it, or how to _think_ about thinking about it

- Sharpen that inner voice in your head that figures out what you like and what you don't like--then apply it with intensity to your work. (This reminds me of some of the ideas in the creativity chapter of _a mating mind_, and about how evolution and solution-finding often works in general, i.e., producing a lot of accidents / variants and amplifying the ones that works (or, equivalently, killing off the variants/genes/sentences/ideas/solution that doesn't work)).

- In a story, "attribute must meet adversity"


### an interesting way to read 

As you read:

1. Ask yourself what you know about the story in 1-2 sentences
2. What are you curious about?
3. Where do you think the story is headed?

### some interesting exercises

(1) Take some prose and cut out 20% of the words. Do it again. And again, so that the prose has ~half of its original length.

What did you cut, add why?

At what stage is the prose the strongest? Why?

(2) Write a story with exactly 200 words. You can only use 50 unique words to do so.
