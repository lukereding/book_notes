## marketing

### consumer analysis

All marketing plans should start with the consumer and her needs. Some questions to ask:

- What is need category?

Note that needs does have to be tangible; advertising can stir of a need for love or adventure, e.g.

- What is buying the product? Who is using the product?
- What is the buying process?

Possibly useful: awareness -> information search -> evaluate alternatives -> purchase -> evaluate

Kind of interesting: Apparently a lot of car ads are meant for people that _have already bought the car in the advertisement_ to reinforce that they made the right decision.

- Is what I'm selling high- or low-involvement?

It can be useful to identify whether your product is low/high involvement and significantly differentiated or not from other similar products. Within each of the four cells there are different consumer forces are work. 

You do yourself wonders if you can turn a low-involvement product into a high-involvement product.

- How can I segment the market?

The narrower the segmentation, the  more effectively you can target marketing efforts. Common to segment by demographics, psychographics (e.g. personality, lifestyle), and behavior (useage, purchase history, brand loyalty, responsiveness to price).

### market analysis

- What's the relevant market?

I.e. marketing segmentation. E.g.: All coffee -> gourmet coffee -> non-flavored -> sold to consumers in grocery stores. Is the resulting segment large enough to evaluation producing a product?

- Where is the product in the product lifecycle?

Where a product is in the product lifecycle determines what marketing strategies you might use. _Introduction_: education. _Growth_: education and selective distribution. _Maturity_: price, brrand loyalty. _Decline_: price, advertising less important. 

- What are the key competitive factors in the industry?

May include: price, quality, service, advertising, R&D


### review of the competition and self

SWOT is useful:
- What are you good at?
- What are your competitors good at?
- Comparison of resources between you and the competition

What are the barriers to entry? These vary widely by industry.

Use _perceptual mapping_ to compare how customers perceive your brand / compared to others.

### review of the distribution channels

The choice of channel influences the price you can charge and thus your margins. Options include retailers, direct to consumer, wholesellers, distributors.

It's also important to understand how each of the players in the distribution channel profit. For example, if you wanted to produce coffee to sell in grocery stores: grower -> broker -> processor -> wholeseller -> retailer -> consumers. At each stage someone takes a cut. 

Who has the power in the channels?

### development of the marketing mix

Four Ps:
- price
  - cost plus - the wrong way to price
  - perceived value to customer (i.e. disregard the cost)
  - skimming - charge a high price early on due to novelty (think 3d TVs)
  - penetration - use a low price initially to gain market share, lower production costs per unit by producing a lot
  - price / quality relationship - price based on perceived quality
  - meet compeition 
  - meet profit goals based on the size of the market
  - price based on elasticity of the buyer 
- promotion
  - advertising, direct selling, sales promotion (to the consumer or the distribution channel), personal selling, PR / publicity
  - gross ratings points (GRP) = reach * frequency (e.g. of an ad)
- place
  - What distribution channels should I use? Exclusive vs. selective vs. mass. Selective channels might demand _cooperative payments_. 
- product
  - How does the product fit with other products I offer?
  - How is different from other products?
  - Product life cycle concerns

### evaluation of the economics

Understand the _fixed_ and _variable_ costs.

> total costs = (variable costs per unit * unit solds) + fixed costs

Calculate your breakeven point to see whether it's reasonable:

> break even unit volume = fixed costs / (selling price - variable costs)

Similarly, you can determine the target volume needed to sell to generate an expected profit by moving profit into the numerator of the equation above:

> target volume = (fixed costs + profit) / (selling price - variable costs)

Understand whether the breakeven calculations are reasonable given your market.

It's also necessary at this stage to understand how long it might take to recoop your investment:

> initial investment / annual profit



### revision and extension of the above


## ethics

Relativism says that ethics are relative to the given circumstances:

- naive relativism: every person has their own standards
- role relativism: distinguishs the private individual from the public role that individual plays
- social relativism: relative to the industry, e.g.
- cultural relativism: we can't compare ethical standards across cultures

Also:

- utilitarianism: an action is justified if it provides the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people
- universalism: any action is okay as long as the intention behind the action was pure, since we only have control over our actions, not results

### stakeholder analysis

Useful tool for thinking about ethical dilemas:

- Enumerate all the stakeholders involved
- Enumerate the harms and benefits to each
- Determine the rights and responsibilities of each
- Consider the power of each
- Think about the short- and long-term consequences
- Generate contingency plans for other scenarios
- Make a judgement
