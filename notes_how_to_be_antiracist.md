A racist is someone who supports a racist policy through action or inaction, or expresses a racist idea. Racist policies produce and sustain racial inequities. Racial inequities occur when two or more racial groups aren't on approximately equal footing. Every policy is either racist or antiracist. In any given momement, we can be racist or antiracist. When we express a racist idea, we are acting in a racist way, but we can act in an anti-racist way in the next moment.

Racists see people as the problem, not policy. [This is a more common mistake humans make, i.e., the fundamental attribution error, to attribute the way someone is to something innate in them as opposed to their circumstances or environment.]

Racists form racial hierarchies. There are no hierarchies for the antiracist. Assimilationists are racists because they believe that one racial group is superior to some other racial group. E.g. bussing black students to predominantly white schools is a racist policy but it implicitly assumes that black children will develop better from steeping in whiteness and white culture, i.e., it presupposes a racial hierarchy instead of seeing that unequal resources and oppurtunity is what leads to any perceived achievement gap.

A biological racist asserts that any biological differences between races form a hierarchy of value; the antiracist know that any biological differences are irrelevant to the humanity of each race.

On the idea of post-racial:

> Race is a mirage but one that humanity has organized itself around in very real ways. Imagining away the existence of races in a racist world is as conserving and harmful as imagining away classes in a capitalist world--it allows the ruling races and classes to keep on ruling.

Cultural racists create a cultural standard and impose a cultural hierarchy among racial groups.

Behavioral antiracists see racial group behavior as fictional and individual behavior real. Any time someone racializes behavior--e.g. describing something as black behavior--they are expressing a racist idea. 

Race insects with class, with gender, with sexual orientation. To be antiracist is to see the humanity of _all_ people, of _all_ people. 

The ultimate source of racist idealogy is self-interest, not ignorance or hate.
