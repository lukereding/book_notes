# Ruined by design

Mike Monteiro


## the ethics of design

- a designer is first and foremost a human being
- a designer is responsible for the work they put into the world
- **a designer values impact over form**
  - ultimately we have to judge what we do based on what consequences it has / its impact
  - **a broken gun is better designed than a working gun**
  - a database that keeps tracks of immigrants to be deported will always be broken
- a designer ownes the people who hire them not just their labor, but their counsel
  - connection to being a "rented brain" in technology strategy patterns
  - your job is to evaluate the impact of your work and relay that back to who you work for
  - "We're not hired just to dig a ditch, but to evaluate the economic, sociological, and ecological impact of that ditch. If the ditch fails, those tests, it's our job to destroy the shovels."
- a designer welcome criticism
- a designer strives to know their audience
- a designer does not believe in edge cases
- a designer is part of a professional community
- a designer welcomes a diverse and competitive felid
  - not hiring something because they aren't a good cultural fit is racist, elitist, sexist, or some combination
- a designer takes time for self-reflection


## part 1: how designers destroy the world

- saying "no" and "why" are the foundations of design work
- "labor without counsel is not design"
- "excessive speed tends to blur one's purpose"
- "good leaders should aspire to have their fingerprints all over hard decisions"
- there's a bit of rant in here about efficiencies, and how pursuing efficiencies at all costs is not the right answer: there's life and interest and diversity in the lack of efficiencies. 
- when we design things, we can't just think of our paycheck, or our employers. we have to think about the broader impact to society. he argues that all designers have a _responsibility_ to society as as whole
- if you're being asked to work on shady shit, your options are 
  - quit
  - devote some percentage of your time to things to clear your conscience. he refers to these as __ethical offsets__ and thinks they're BS. you can't make the world better if you spend 90% of your time making society worse and 10% of your time making it better
  - work within the system (connection to _rules for radicals_.) adn do our jobs the way society needs us to do them
  - you do it anyway. "someone else will do it if i don't." just because someone else is willing to be a jerk doesn't give you permission to be a jerk, or make you any less of a jerk.
- design is about solving problems; it's not a personal expression. (connection to how munari writes about design)
- "leadership by attrition"
- "it's like asking someone to turn a folding chair into a mid-century lounge chair. I can duct tape a pillow to the seat, but the actual opportunity to design any comfort into that chair is long past"
- "Engineers design things all the time. What a professional designer brings to the act is intention. But in order to do that, the designer needs to behave intentionally."
- there's a good chunk in here that illustrates why we need diverse teams to build better products
  - e.g., twitter designed by a bunch of white guys, never thought about, for example, harassment and what to do about it on the platform, because the people who designed it had never been harassed
- "today's design isn't done by rockstars. It isn't done by ninjas, and it isn't done by Solo superman. It's done by team, so you know how to work together, to look at a problem from multiple points of view, and a diverse set of experiences"

## part 2: what we can do to fix it

- we can choose where to work, try to change things from the inside. only work for leaders you respect who listen and are willing to take criticism and effect change
- as a designer, we're not hired to get approval from the people that hire us. we are hired to solve problems, and your work should be judged based on how well it solves those problems without creating new ones in the process
- you really work for the people who come in contact with your work. you work for the people not in the room.
- "using our labor to help others should be the basic minimum that we aspire to"
- "if you care about working ethically, it is imperative that you understand how your company makes money, because your labor is going to be used to help them do it."
- "the world has assholes in it, and we need to design with the assholes in mind". reminds me of all the loopholes that people in china would use to take advantage of all the incentives that uber was offering there.
- "the law often drags far behind what's ethical". remember that ethical != legal
- "if you hired me to do good work, I owe it to you, and more importantly, the people that work is going to affect to do good work. I also need to tell you why the work is good, to walk you through all its aspects, and to explain to you how I reached the conclusion that that work is good."
  - on being confident: "my confidence isn't for my benefit were even my bosses benefit, it's for the people's benefit. When we see them as the reason for our confidence, then humility is an expensive, it's also selfish. How dare you? Allow your fear to keep people from being helped."
- "people are not data-driven mammals. People make decisions based on feelings and emotion more than they make decisions based on data." reminds me of something dan kahnman said: no one ever made a decision because of a fact
- "recognize it when you get to the point where you're trying to persuade someone about. Good work, you need a story. Work like a scientist, present like a snake charmer. When I'm trying to present some to someone, I start by painting a picture in the persons mind. There's a future where you do. What's right, and I paint that rosy. There's a future where you do what's wrong, and i paint that dismally. My goal is to get you to walk into that rosier future, the one where everything works out. If you wanna persuade someone, you need to to take them on a little journey."
- sometimes, he argues that things really are fucked and you need to 'throw your body on the gears'
  - there's a fascinating except from _the simple sabotage field manual_ from WWII that includes snippets like
    - bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible
    - give unpleasant worked undeserved promotions
    - reopen decisions that have already been made
    - act stupid
    - never pass on your experiences or skills


### part 3: you can't do it alone

- a bit part of this part of the book is about creating a series of standards, a code of conduct, and licensing designers. this sounds insane at first, but think about other cases where liscences are required
  - driving a car
  - preparing food at a restaurant
  - flying a plane
  - operating on someone or prescribing medicine
- these are all situations where getting things wrong as really bad outcomes for people / society as a whole: you kill someone in your car, make someone sick at your restaurant, crash a plane, make someone sick with medicine they shouldn't be taking. if we recognize that designers, especially in the digital age, have an outsize impact on society, and that a lot of the outcomes we design can have horrible consequences: it actually makes a lot of sense. though it'll still never happen.
