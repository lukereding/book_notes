# _judgement in managerial decision-making_

This is a lot like other books I like--_Thinking Fast and Slow_, e.g.--but it's more to the point and more applied. I liked it a lot.

The main idea of the book is to say, "Rational DM is the right way to make decisions--here are all the reasons you are biased not to make rational decisions so you can guard against them."

## intro to common biases

Components of a rational decision:

1. Define the problem. Most people define the problem in terms of the proposed solution, or miss the actual problem, or treat the symptoms. Avoid all these.
2. Identify the criteria.
3. Weight the criteria. 
4. Generate alternatives / possible courses of action.
5. Rate each alternative on each crtieria.
6. Compute the optimal decision.

One thing I really liked about this book with Bazerman classifies all the ways that interfer with rational decision-making into broader classes:

### the availability heuristic

- ease of recall
- retrievability
- presumed associated


### the representativeness heuristic

- insivitivity to base rates
- insenitivity to sample size
- misconceptions about chance
- regression to the mean (we tend to naively develop predictions based on the assumption of perfect correlation with past data)
- the conjugation fallacy (the linda problem)

### anchoring and adjustment

- insufficient anchor adjustment
- conjunctive and disjunctive events bias (when multiple events need to occur, we overestimate the true likelihood, while if only one of many events need to occur, we underestimate the true likelihood; implications for timing / budgets; even when the probability of something bad happening is small, if there are a lot of things that have to go correctly, the probability of failure of the system may be substational)
- overconfidence

### other

- confirmation bias
- hindsight and the curse of knowledge


## judgement under uncertainty

We tend to discount uncertaintly because we don't like it and it's easier to pretend it doesn't exist. Example: you might have made a decision thinking about what was most likely to occur without thinking through the potential consequences.

People vary in their risk-tolerance/-seeking behavior. People that are risk-taking in some domains are often risk-averse in other domains. If you make all your decisions via expected value calculations, you are acting in a risk-neutral way.

A lot of this chapter deals with prospect theory; some core things to keep in mind:

- people evaluate losses and rewards w/r/t a reference point
- our responses to losses are more extreme than our responses to a similar gain (e.g. we are generally loss averse)
- we overweight the probability of low-probability events and underweight the probability of high-probability events

A lot of this chapter deals with framing, but there are some interesting points:

- Connected or linked decisions, common in companies, are best made cohesively. Making the decisions separately is likely to lead to irrational (non-optimal) choice and inconsistency
- Reference points serve as anchors and have a huge impact on our decision-making. If many reference points exist, always think about the problem from each reference point and examine any contridictions that emerge.
- People value the destruction of uncerrtaintly very highly. Connection to insurance; maybe people are, in part, buying insurance to eliminate the worry caused by uncertainty about floods/weather/accidents/etc.
- A really interesting idea: __transactional utility__. Basically, we feel good getting a deal on something compared to our expectations, even if it's inconsistent with other decisions we would have made (e.g. buying the item in the first place). 
- He brings up the __endowment effect__ and notes that it's common across experients for a 2:1 difference in value placed by sellers vs. buyers for different goods (e.g. sellers think $2X is a good price for what they have, but buyers are willing to pay $X).

Really interesting quotation from Dawes (1988):

> Such people's natural desire to reduce uncertainty, which may be basic to the whole cognitive enterprise of understanding the world, runs amok to the point that come to believe uncertainty does not exist.

## motivational biases

Most of this chapter is about navigating the two selves: the short-term self what wants instant gratification (the doer) and the long-term self that wants a better life in the future (the planner). A lot of economists have the view that the short-term self does a lot of stupid stuff and we should be listening more to our long-term selves. Moods, emotions, transient concerns often result in us relying on quick and thoughtless decision-making that puts us right in the hands of the cognitive traps outlined above.

One theme to emerge from this book is that it's often advantageous to look at many decisions simultaneously as opposed to one at a time. We can take a more holistic approach to problems and are less likely to make a series of internally inconsistent decisions.

He goes on to outline four positive illusions: (1) we tend to have positive views of ourselves, (2) have unrealistic optimism, (3) think we're in control when we're not, and (4) attribute things to ourselves instead of chance/external factors.

> Because positive illusions typically provide a short-term benefit at a larger long-term cost, they can become a form of emotional procrastination.

#### the role of regret in decision-making

This section was fascinating. The argument is that we make a lot of decisions to avoid to regret we think we might feel in the future.

- Really interesting: bronze metal winners at the Olympics tend to be happier with their acheivement than silver metal winners. 
- People tend to feel more regret for acts of commission (what they did) as opposed to acts of omission (inaction / what they didn't do). This biases us towards inaction in some cases.

## the nonrational escalation of committment

A lot of this chapter deals with the sunk cost fallacy. Some interesting notes:

- Groups are likely likely to fall victim to sunk costs, but if they do, they increase escalation more than an individual decision-maker would
- Implications for bidding and auctions: the curse of the winner. In a lot of auctions the winner tends to pay too much for the item.
- He references the bidding game I was first introduced to by Raiffa in his book on negotiation; people typically bid $20-70 for a $20 bill in the game; in one case $204. This dude has earned $25k playing this game in his classes.
- In auctions, put yourself in the place of the other bidders and play out what might happen
- From an organizational standpoint, there's evidence to suggest that people are rewarded for escalating committment even when it makes no sense to do so. We also tend to like people that are consistent and confident, which biases us to think that leaders that escalate committment are doing the right thing. 

An idea I've seen crop up everything that makes a lot of sense to me: __people should be rewarded for the quality of their decision-making, not the outcome of their decisions__. I've never actually seen this donee in practice, though. The result is that we reward people who happen to get lucky and disincentize people for taking thoughtful approachs to making decisions.

## fairness in decision-making

Overall this chapter suggests that reference points and framing are key to understanding whether we think something is fair or not. In particular, the sequential or simultaneous presentation of choices can lead to different reference points which in turn influence our perception of fairness. When a series of outcomes are evaluated sequentially, the outcome of the first becomes the reference point for the next.

> ... fairness considerations play a more dominant role in decision making when individuals need this information to interpret their option. When the outcomes to self are apparent, individuals exhibit significantly less concern for fairness.

## common investment mistakes

Investment mistakes have their root in:
- overconfidence
- optimism
- denying that random events are random; thinking "hot" funds will stay "hot"
- status quo; we don't shift asset allocation over time, even when it makes sense, and still to the status quo)
- loss aversion; we tend to use our purchase price of a stock as a reference point. If we want to make money, the purchase price is irrelevant; all we should be thinking about is the future price of the stock regardless of what we paid for it


## making rational decisions in negotiations

Framework for approaching negotiations:
- __alternatives to negogiated agreement__. Always come up with your BATNA (best alternative to a negotatied settlement) before negogiating. We should prefer any agreement that exceeds our BATNA over impasse; the BATNA is the point at which we are indifferent to a settlement. It's really easy for emotions to take over and to negogiate a bad deal if you haven't carefully considered your BATNA beforehand.
- __interests of the parties__. There is a difference between each party's stated positions and their underlying interests. Interests are underlying issues that coould matter to the negoiators if they were made aware of them.
- __the relative importance of each party's interests.__ We should be aware of how important each issue is to us before we negotiate. 

One of the biggesdt takeaways for this book to me was __the difference between claiming value and creating value__.

#### claiming value

This is extent that most people think about when negotiating. In a salary negoiation, you claim a lot of value if you're able to extract a high salary, for example. Claiming value is a zero-sum game. Claiming value is all about determining your own reservation point and that of your partner and determining whether a bargaining zone exists where a settlement could be found. Most people fail to think carefully about their BATNA and the BATNA of the other party. Raiffa's book on negoiation has a really good example of what this looks like in a real-life example of buying a house.

By definition, one-issue negotiations do not create value.

#### creating value

The main point here is that negoiations don't have to be zero-sum: the asymmetry in beleifs, interests, and priorities of each party means that by being creative and looking at more than just one value (e.g. money) we can find settlements that are more likely to be Pareto efficient and have more value to both parties than any single-issue settlement would have.

In order to create value, you have to examine the underlying interests of each party, not just their stated positions. It's possible to craft agreements based on the tradeoffs the parties exhibit for each of the interests at stake. __Differences are oppurtunities to create value__. E.g. you can often create value through bets. If the parties have different thoughts about what's likely to happen the future, a settlement might capitalize on that to the satisfaction of both parties. If one party is more risk-averse and the other party more risk-seeking, a settlement might include a guanenteed lump sum for the former party and an uncertain, larger payoff for the latter party, for example. __Contingent contracts__ can also be a useful tool to create value. 

The key to creating value is exposing the interests of the other party. How can you do that?

- build trust and share information
- ask questions. negotiators that ask more questions and talk less tend to me more successful
- strategically disclose information
- make multiple offers simultaneously
- search for post-settlement settlements. This is a really interesting idea: once you come to an agreement, bring in a meditor that's allowed to 'see the cards' of our party. The mediator might be able to craft a better deal with both parties. In cases like this, each party would have veto power over any settlement proposed by the mediator.

## negotiator cognition

Most negotiators think about negotions only in terms of claiming, not creating value. Negoitations don't have to be zero-sum. Thinking about multiple issues _at the same time_ is the best way to avoid this zero-sum thinking. 

> Framing effects suggest that in induce concessionary behavior in an opponent, a negoitor should always create anchors that lead the opposition towards a positive frame.

Should you make the first offer in a negotiation? If you think you have a good idea of the bargaining zone, then you can set an anchor by being first to place the offer. 

People that think more from the perspective of their opponents tend to do better in negotiations.



## other / random

Whenever we're asked to estimate the associated between two dichotomous events, we need to think about all four possible outcomes, not justthe two that come most easily to mind.
