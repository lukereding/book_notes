# Essentialism

This was one of the books that straddles the line between business and self-help, and though it was a but cheesy at times, much of the book resonated with me.


- think of yourself as a consultant. do only what a consultant would do
- less but better
- the steps are: explore, eliminate, execute 
- you often aren’t given your options, but your ability to choose among them cannot be taken away from you. think less about the options and more about the choice. you're played a hand of cards: what you do with them is up to you
- consider, maybe, that you always have to content with some number of problems. it’s just a matter of choosing those you’d rather contend with. **there are no solutions: only trade-offs**
- effort != results. think about what result you’re trying to achieve. think about what’s the truest work you could do to bring about that result
- discern more—find more options—to find the truly great / right paths and do less 
- you can’t ignore the reality of trade offs
- you need time to think. lots of time. no distractions. discipline. totally disconnected. things that feel counterproductive like this can end up unlocking a lot of productivity
- in every set of facts something essential is hidden 
- play sparks exploration and is essential
- the best violinists not only practice more, they get 8.5 hour of sleep on average every night 
- "90 percent rule" — basically, only do something if you’re >90% sure / psyched about it. prevents you from ignoring trade-offs and forces you to think about the single most import quantity that you’re interested in. apply specific criteria and only accept the top ten percent of opportunities 
- make decision criteria both explicit and selective
- essential intent is concrete and inspirational. it’s measurable and leaves no ambiguity of whether you’ve hit the mark. it articulates a trade-off or makes a large decision that makes hundreds of other smaller decisions unnecessary
- there's a lot in here about saying no -- people are effective because they say no
- "a graceful 'no' grows out of a clear but instated calculation of a tradeoff." the next time you say "yes" to something, think about what you are going to say no to, to what you’re giving up
- sink cost fallacy can be powerful. to get around the endowment effect, pretend you don’t own the item and ask yourself how much you would pay for it. try to view the situation as an outsider, a consultant, someone without ties to the situation
- the idea of zero-based accounting to your time (starting from zero and working your way to some result, instead of taking the default as a baseline)
- "reverse pilots"—try not doing some task and see what happens (publishing a weekly report that consumes a lot of time)
- an editor uses **deliberate subtraction** to get at the essence of things. you make things better by subtraction
- boundaries can be empowering because they protect your time for the really important things and often short circuit having to say no all the time
- you like to help people, but often it can go against you. you can’t just solve their problem, otherwise you’re enabling them. we rob their ability to solve the problem. 
- create buffers in your life. plan for unexpected results. extreme and early preparation
- think in terms of constraints and bottlenecks. what’s holding back everything else? what parts of the system are weak?
- **think about the goal / outcome. think about where you are. think about what’s different between the goal and where you are. remove those obstacles one by one**
- ask yourself: *what’s important now?*

> Whoever it is that's trying to siphon off your time and energies for their own purpose, the only solution is to put up fences. And not at the moment the request is made-you need to put up your fences well in advance, clearly demarcating what's off limits so you can head off time wasters and boundary pushers at the pass. Remember, forcing these people to solve their own problems is equally beneficial for you and for them.


> Think of the most important project you are trying to get done at work or at home. Then ask the following five questions: (1) What risks do you face on this project? (2) What is the worst-case scenario? (3) What would the social effects of this be? (4) What would the financial impact of this be? and (5) How can you invest to reduce risks or strengthen financial or social resilience? Your answer to that fifth and crucial question will point you to buffers--perhaps adding another 20 percent to the project's budget, or getting a PR person on board to handle any potential negative press, or calling a board meeting to manage shareholder expectations-that you can create to safeguard you against unknowable events.
