## notes on _how to win friends and influence people_

A lot of this book is dated and trite but it still has use useful insight into human nature. These aren't so much notes as the 'principle' behind each of the chapters.

#### fundamental techniques in handling people

- Don't criticize, condemn, or complain

- Give honest and sincere appreciation.

Most people want to feel important and feel like they're doing important work. Be 'hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.' Flattery is insincere; it's telling the person what they think of themselves.

- Arouse in the other person an eager want.

The only want to influence other people is to talk about what _they_ want, even if you want something out of them. So understanding people's needs is pretty important; plenty of successful people are good at getting inside people's heads and understanding their needs. Before asking someone to do something, think: "How can I make this person _want_ to do it?"

#### ways to make people like you

- Be genuinely interested in other people

- Smile

- Call people by their name

I find this is true about myself. I also recall Mark's advice to 'say their name' if there's someone in the room while giving a talk that has contributed to what you're talking about. 

- Be a good listener and encourage others to talk about themselves

- Talk in terms of the other person's interests

- Make the other person feel important


#### how to win people to your way of thinking

- The only way to get the best or an argument is to avoid it

- Show respect for the other person's opinions; never tell them they're wrong

It's useful to acknowledge you might be wrong. Most people, when they hear an argument, don't try to understand it; they react to it or evaluate / judge it. 

- If you are wrong, admit it quickly and empathetically

- Begin in a friendly way

- Get the other person saying 'yes' immediately

Overlap with Calidini's advice.

- Let the other person do a great deal of the talking 

The other person know more about their problems / aspirations / motivations than you do. Let them talk. 

- Let the person feel that the idea is his or hers

- Try to see things from the other person's point of view

- Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires

Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine what stresses they're under, their motivations, etc. He gives the example of a hotel manager. The manager doesn't want to shut down the elevator for more than a couple hours, even though repairs will take a day. Instead of arguing, the elevator repairman tells the hotel manager that he's concerned that the elevator might get worse and require an even longer repair, which the manager obviously wants to avoid. By framing it as a choice, and reminding the repairman about his motives and long-term interests, the conversation goes a lot smoother. 

- Appeal to nobler motives

- Dramatize your ideas

- Throw down a challenge


#### how to change people without giving offense or arousing resentment

- Begin with praise and appreciation

- Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly

Don't follow the pattern '[good thing]..._but_ [bad thing]". Replace _but_ with _and_. 

- Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person

- Ask questions instead of giving direct orders

People are more likely to do something if they feel like they have some autonomy / say in the manner; asking a question can allow that to happen.

- Let the other person save face

- Praise any and all improvements

- Give the person a fine reputation to live up to

Pretend like the thing to correct is already something innate to the person. You can tell someone, "I know you're really organized, so I expect next time your reports to be laid out more cleanly" or whatever.

- Use encouragement and make the fault seem easy to correct

- Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest
