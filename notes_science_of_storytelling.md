# The science of storytelling

Will Storr

I liked this book a lot. It reinforced some of the themes from similar books (e.g., in some ways its very similar to _writing for story_), but psychologically, it's much deeper than those books. Storr talks about story as a parallel for life, self-discovery, and what makes us human is a way that I found satisfying.

What follows are some random notes I took down while reading.

He argues the dramatic question in stories revolves around the question: Who are you?

Every story amounts to 'something changed'. 

He argues that to be successfully, our brains exist to manipulate the external world and have some semblance of control. This need for control forms the basis of our own mental models of the world, as well as those of our characters, whose mental models are often flawed in ways that they must overcome during the story.

We work to resolve incomplete information--even for questions of no importance. That's why we'll sometimes watch until the end of a movie, even if we sort of know how it's going to end--there's a possibility it will end differently, and we want things resolved neatly for us. 

```
              |       .
 curiosity    |    .     . 
              |   .         .
               ------------------
                knowledge
```


That is, we're maximally curious when we have enough context to understand what's going on / the question / problem, but not enough that we know everything. 

To arouse curiosity:
- pose a question / puzzle
- offer a sequence of events with an anticipated but unknown resolution
- violate expectations in a way that triggers a search for an explanation
- knowledge of possession of information by someone else

Details / specifics make things seem real, even for things that are impossible or can't exist.

A lot of human drama comes from incorrectly understadning the intentions of others--think about what does A think B is thinking about A?

Using metaphors and similies actives a broader spectrum of brain regions that comferring the same info without making the comparison. This isn't true for tired metaphors that becomes part of the vernacular.

All scenes in stories must have forward motion--they must constantly arose curiousity within the reader, be able to stand on their own (dramatically), and rachet the tension in the story up. The be conherent, scenes should have a 'because' connecting them and not a 'and then'.

Everyone has their own, flawed filter of the world that defines how they view things, their perceptions.

Everyone has core beliefs that form their identity that they defend against evidence of reason. Confusion around these beliefs make from drama and character development. 

In a sense, we're all fictional character. We are the product of our own minds.

Memories forma a core component of who we are, but they aren't to be trusted; they can be very biased or invented.

We are constantly making ourselves out to the heros in our own minds. Even when we do wrong, we justify it so that it fits our hero-making narrative of ourselves. Clashes around these narratives provide fertile ground for drama.

Stories involve people whose model of the world get fundamentally changed. The changes starts when there's some sort of change that reveals their model to be flawed and those their ability to control the external world, which previously their model was able to provide.

Ideally, stories exist at a conscious and a subconscious level.

Moral outrage is at the heart of many stories. Also: changes to status / hierarchy.

Often, authors hint at causes and effects of why characters are flawed the way they are. Revealing the reasons for their flawed filter can build empathy, but withholding it can make stories seem deeper. This is the idea of _origin damage_: there was some damage done, likely in the first 20 years of the person's life when their brain was still forming, that altered how they view and interact with the world. He argues that all characters need this, even if it's not revealed in the story, to give them depth and make their motivations believable.

People, including in stories, are goal-directed--this gives a story thrill and momentum. 

Protagonists must take an active role in struggling / succeeding in their goals--things can't just happen to them.

Plots exist to put characters in a new psychological realm where they are tested / struggle.

Tragedies are stories where instead of changing, the character doubles down on their flaw and bad things happens as a result (e.g., death). Still, these still can be satisfying because they satisfy our need for control and our need to make sense out of the chaos of the world. They answer the dramatic question: Who are you? 

"Find out what people believe to be sacred" -> rampant irrationality, window into their flawed filters of the world

He advocates for a pretty interesting tool called the 'sacred flaw' approach for crafting stories, which ensures that character development occurs and the plots exists to further that development. These flaws, which you generate for each character, much be very precise, even if they are never revealed to the reader / audience.
