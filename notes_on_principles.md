## notes on _principles: life and work_

These are less notes and more 'things I highlighted that I thought were significant enough to remember.'

----------------

> 1. Have clear goals. 2. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals. 3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. 4. Design plans that will get you around them. 5. Do what’s necessary to push these designs through to results.

> I’ve come to see that people who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects of second- and subsequent-order consequences rarely reach their goals.

> Proximate causes are typically the actions (or lack of actions) that lead to problems, so they are described with verbs (I missed the train because I didn’t check the train schedule). Root causes run much deeper and they are typically described with adjectives (I didn’t check the train schedule because I am forgetful). You can only truly solve your problems by removing their root causes, and to do that, you must distinguish the symptoms from the disease.

> People interested in making the best possible decisions are rarely confident that they have the best answers.

> Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases.

> One of the most important decisions you can make is who you ask questions of. Make sure they’re fully informed and believable.

Bingo (assumes you're making a lot of similar decisions over a longish time period, but regardless, forces you to quantify the gains and risk involved in each outcome):

> Make your decisions as expected value calculations.

> Get rid of irrelevant details so that the essential things and the relationships between them stand out. As the saying goes, “Any damn fool can make it complex. It takes a genius to make it simple.”

The idea of 'Believability-Weighted Decision Making' is something that's either stuck with me from this book or I've taken away from some otheer books I've read, but it makes a lot of sense. When I first starteed working, sometimes people would ask my opinion about stuff I had no idea about and I was hesistant to tell them anything but my 'believeability' was so low.

> It seems to me that if you look back on yourself a year ago and aren’t shocked by how stupid you were, you haven’t learned much.

This is some good (if not obvious) practical advice:

> There are many reasons why meetings go poorly, but frequently it is because of a lack of clarity about the topic or the level at which things are being discussed

This is definately true. Ties to Apple's idea of a directly responsible individual.

> Too often groups will make a decision to do something without assigning personal responsibilities, so it is not clear who is supposed to follow up by doing what. Be clear in assigning personal responsibilities.

> When someone says, “I believe X,” ask them: What data are you looking at? What reasoning are you using to draw your conclusion?

> It’s more important to do big things well than to do the small things perfectly.

> Remember that if you are expecting people to be much better in the near future than they have been in the past, you are probably making a serious mistake. People who repeatedly operate in a certain way will probably continue to operate that way because that behavior reflects what they’re like. Since people generally change slowly, you should expect slow improvement (at best).

> Great managers are not philosophers, entertainers, doers, or artists. They are engineers. They see their organizations as machines and work assiduously to maintain and improve them...Great managers orchestrate rather than do. Like the conductor of an orchestra, they do not play an instrument, but direct their people so that they play beautifully together. Micromanaging, in contrast, is telling the people who work for you exactly what tasks to do or doing their tasks for them. Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement.

> If you didn’t make an expectation clear, you can’t hold people accountable for it not being fulfilled.

> The more vividly you can visualize how the scenario you create will play out, the more likely it is to happen as you plan. Visualize who will do what when and the result they’ll produce. This is your mental map of your machine.
