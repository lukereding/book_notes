# Decisive

Chip and Dan Health

This was a great book that differs from other decision-making books I've read in that (a) it wasn't focused solely on biases and (b) it didn't approach decision-making from the perspective of rationality, like a lot of, e.g., Raiffa's book do. As a result, I thought the book was easier to read and more focused on practical advice.

### Tips 

- "should I do this OR that" -> "Can i do this AND that"
- The Vanishing Options Test: What would you do if the options you're considering are off the table?
- Think opportunity cost
- "whether or not" decisions are usually too narrowly framed and should be a red flag 
- multitrack whenever possible
- avoid sham options
- what happens when you consider the opposite of what you think is true?
- For each option, ask: What would have to be true for this option to be the right answer?
- talk to an expert
- 10/10/10: what are the consequences of your decision in 10 minutes, 10 months, 10 years?
- run tests when you can
- what would I tell my friend to do in this situation?
- use premortems
- use tripwires to create a space for risk-taking and avoid sunk cost (predictions => tripwires)



### Commonalities with other books

There's a lot of overlap here with _The Art of Science of Negotiation_ and _Smart Choices_. These books:

- Emphasize the importance of finding options outside of those that you've initially thought of, and expanding the 'axes' along which you're thinking. 
- Emphasize the importance of values / reframing / thinking carefully about your objective function to figure out if you're actually solving the right problem by making the decision

### Introduction

- The DM _process_ is roughly 6 times more important than the analysis of the options itself. "Superb analysis is useless unless the decision process gives it a fair hearing."
- Most companies make decisions by having the team argue one side of the case

### The four villains of DM

- narrow framing -- we define our choice too narrowly

  - we tend to only focus on options in 'our spotlight', but we need to expand options in order to arrive at the best decision

- confirmation bias -- seeking out information that confirms our beliefs

- short-term option

- overconfidence

  - even when doctors are "completely certain" about a diagnosis, they're wrong 40% of the time

  The WRAP process:

  

  Widen your options

  Reality-test your assumptions

  Attain distain before deciding

  Prepare to be wrong

## Widen your options

How do we generate options?

### Avoid a narrow frame

- A lot of companies make decisions in a terrible way
  - e.g. Snapple and M&A
  - 29% of decisions in orgs actually consider more than one alternative (they are 'whether or not' decisions)
- We normally have more options than we initially think we do
- Thinking about **opportunity cost** can help avoid a narrow frame: what are we giving up by making this choice? what could we do with the same time and money?
  - simply remind people when, e.g., deciding whether to buy a movie, than if they don't buy the movie, they could use the money for other purchases, almost doubles the percentage of people who pass on the movie

- The **Vanishing Options Test** can help you break out of a narrow frame. Ask yourself: What if the options you're considering wereoff the table? What would you do then? This really forces the 'spotlight' to move
- "whether or not" decisions are usually too narrowly framed and should be a red flag 

### multitrack

- multitracking = considering more than one option simultaneously
  - e.g. designers decisioning a logo for a website. those that 'multitracked' produced better logos, better click-through rates, and were happier with the process than those than single-tracked, even when amount of feedback was controlled for
- when you multitrack, you learn the 'shape' of the problem better
  - improves our understanding of the problem we're facing
- Multitracking helps keep egos in track.
  - Studies have found that while it sounds slower, multitracking can lead to faster DM (though personally, I think this is likely due to sham options)
- Simply considering one extra option can boost the quality of DM
  - in a study of decisions made by the board of a company, considering more than one alternative made 6 times as many 'very good' decisions in retrospect
- Beware of "sham options"
- Prevention vs. promotion mindsets
  - prevention = preventing negative outcomes. promotion = seeking positive outcomes. this ideas are broadly aligned with risk aversion and risk taking behavior
  - Companies that used both during a recession tended to fare better than companies that just used one
- Push for this AND that instead of this OR that

### find someone who's solved your problem

- Look outside: benchmarking, competitive analysis, best practices

- Look "inside": find "bright spots"

- to be proactive, encode your thinking into a 'playlist'

  - e.g. a canned list of questions of stimuli to get your thinking going
  - Can be used similar to a checklist, but while checklist are prescriptive, the playlist would be generative, forcing you to think about considerations that were important in the past, and sparking new ideas / alternatives for you to consider

- Can also make connections to other disciplines to solve problems

  - i.e. redefine your problem more broadly and see how other people / nature has solved the problem
  - e.g. Speedo looked to sharks to understand how to make a swimsuit that enabled faster swimming
  - Use of analogies => connection to hofstadter's book

  ## reality-test your assumptions

  How do we assess the options we've generated?

  ### consider the opposite

- confirmation bias = hunting for information that conforms to our _a priori_ beliefs or expectations

- need to spark constructive disagreement

- it can be really useful to look at each option and ask: What would need to be right for this option to be the right choice?

- need to ask disconfirming questions

  - to generate these questions, ask yourself: "What's the most likely way I could fail to get the right information in this situation?"
  - Don't tiptoe around; ask questions that get at the core concerns you care about, e.g. "What problems does the bike you're selling me have?" Sellers in situations like this are much more likely to reveal issues when asking about them directly

- caution: probing questions can backfire when there's a power dynamic

- What happens when we force ourselves to consider the opposite of what we think is true?

  ### zoom in, zoom out

- We tend to discount base rate and averages more than we should

  - e.g. we think "we are different," "this doesn't apply to me", etc., when, e.g., thinking about opening a restaurant
  - we tend to trust our impressions over the averages. our situations might be different from the average situation, but the base rate should be our starting point

- the inside view = our evaluation of a specific situation. the outside view = how things generally unfold in similar situations.

- if you can't find the base rate rates, experts are good at assessing base rates

  - experts tend to be really bad at predicting, though

- a "close-up" can view texture to what's missing from the outside view 

  - base rates are good at establishing norms; close-ups create intuition

- ideally, we need to be zoom in and out => outside view + close-up



### ooch

- ouch = run a small-scale test before rolling out an option completely
- even for big decisions, like what career we choose, we don't ooch when it would make a lot of sense 
- ooching is an important strategy because we tend to be really bad at predicting the future
- entrepreneurs tend to ooch naturally
  - test, don't plan
- ooching can be counterproductive for decisions that require commitment
  - best for situations where we need more information, need to unearth risk
- common hiring error: we predict future success instead of ooching and getting a potential hire to work on an example project
- why _predict_ when you could run a test and _know_?



## attain distance before deciding

How to choose among options

### overcome short-term emotion

- the people share the worse decisions they've made, they often recall choices made in the grip of emotion
- 10/10/10
  - how will we feel about the decision in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?
  - helps us make sure we're not _just_ thinking about the short-term
- our decisions are often altered by the mere exposure effect and loss aversion, both of which involve short-term emotion
- loss aversion + mere exposure = status-quo bias
- we can attain distance by looking at the decision from an observer's perspective 
  - e.g. what would my successor do?
- what would i recommend a friend do in a similar situation?
  - can be super effective but is also super easy to do



### honor core priorities

- quieting short-term emotion doesn't make decisions easy
- agonizing decisions are often a sign of conflict among your core values
  - i.e., many hard decisions are _values_ decisions 
- be clear about what your core priorities are!
  - can help at work
  - enables distributed decision-making -- connection to _no rules rules_
- often to carve out time / space to work on core priorities, we have to tackle lesser priorities

## prepare to be wrong

### bookend the future

- Reject point estimates -- you'll make better decisions if you consider the range of likely possibilities
  - a heuristic is to force yourself to think about what could happen if things when really well / really poorly
  - people make more accurate predictions when they're forced to consider the range of possible outcomes
  - the predictions were better when researchers asked people to consider the upper and lower bookends separately
- to prepare for the lower bookend, use a premortem ("it's a year from now and this decision has failed; why?") or "prospective hindsight" to work backwards from a certain future
- to prepare for the upper bookend, use a 'preparade'
- failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA)
  - for everything that could have gone wrong, ask (a) how likely is it? (b) how severe are the consequences? and (c) how likely is it that we'll detect it if failure happens? Multiply all these together to form a prioritization of what's most important to zoom in on
- idea of safety factors
  - e.g. when engineers design elevators, they use a safety factor of 11, i.e., they build the elevator so that it can support 11x the target weight
  - project planning -- microsoft multiples timelines by some factor (1.5) to get to a better estimate of how long something will take
- anticipate problems beforehand to help cope with them



### set a tripwire

- a tripwire can 'wake us up' and make us realize that we have a choice; forces us to reassess
- tripwires can be useful when change is gradual
- tripwires also useful when you're making a big bet
  - e.g. if option A is best we expect Y; if we can measure Y after we pull the trigger, if we don't find Y within some time period, then we revert the decision
  - it's easy to turn predictions in tripwires
- consider deadlines or partitions
  - both function as a sort of stopping point that we use to re-assess a decision
  - both create clear boundaries that can be used to create action
- tripwires can help combat sunk cost fallacy
- tripwires can create a safe space for taking risk
- many useful tripwires are tied to trends, not necessarily dates

### trusting the process

- decisions made by groups must also be seen as fair
- 'bargaining' or compromise makes for good decisions that are seen as fair
  - in studies, it always improved the quality of decisions
  - compromise is also a way of limiting risk by incorporating diverse options
- procedural justice = how people feel about a decision
  - Hitz's method for dealing with people that disagree with his decision: talk about all the reasons why the choice he made is flawed and the advantages of the other decision. makes the other person know that you're aware / have considered the drawbacks of the option you chose
- need to make sure people understand that the process that generates the decision is just
