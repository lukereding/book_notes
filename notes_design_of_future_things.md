# The Design of Future Things

Don Norman



unexpectedly, this is really a book about communication.

the notes here are unstructured and poor.

- the process of making a decision is often more important than the decision itself to humans. big implications here, but norman is talking about this w/r/t interacting with technology and how frustrating it can be when a machine makes a decision opaquely
- he argues the best use of technology in the future will be blending human and machine and creating a _symbiosis_, similar to a horse and its rider. "we need augmentation, not automation". I think for a lot of things, we could benefit from automation, too, but he's more concerned with technology that ordinary people interact with
- designers tend to think their designs communicate, but they really only signal: communication is two-way, signaling is one-way
- there's a section in here about using 'natural signals' instead of artificial signals that i didn't find super compelling are clear 
- the idea of "implicit communication" -- communication that informs without interruption or disturbance (e.g. underlines in books, sounds of elevators)
- designs as aired communication? an interesting idea.

- machines that try to infer motives of people are unsettling at best and dangerous at worse. i think in most cases they're just annoying though
-  could we make things safer by making them look more dangerous than they actually are? the idea of "**risk compensation**" -- "when an activity is changed so that it is perceived to be safer, people take more risks, thereby keeping the accident rate constant." the idea that "making driving more dangerous could make us safer" 
- even in 1854, thoreau complains about people becoming slaves to their tools
- overautomation - automating things, but when human intervention is required, the human isn't really prepared because things have been running so smoothly. e.g. autopilot. i'm also guessing that's why you have to shake the wheel of your tesla every so often when its on autopilot
- it's possible that partial automation will lead to fewer accidents, but those that occur will be worse
- "teamwork requires coordination and communication, plus a good sense of what to expect, a good understand of why things are, or are not, happening"
- "fundamental design rule: provide continual awareness, without annoyance"
- machine / human communication - need to make the machine's response understandable and interpretable
- "informing without overburdening"
- "design: the deliberate shaping of the environment in ways that satisfy individual and societal needs"
- Rules for interaction:
  - provide rich, complex, and natural signals
  - be predictable
  - provide a good conceptual model
  - make the output understandable
  - provide continual awareness, without annoyance
  - exploit natural mapping to make interaction understandable and effective

- rules for interaction between people and machines:
  - keep things simple
  - provide a conceptual model
  - give reasons
  - make people think they are in control
  - continually reassure
  - never label behavior as an error. assume the error is a misunderstanding. be tolerant and helpful, not critical
