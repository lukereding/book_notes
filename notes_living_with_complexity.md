# Living with Complexity

Norman

There were a couple chapters in the book that didn't quite mesh. Besides that there were some interesting ideas in here. Some main things I learned about or took away:

- Tesler's Law of Irreducible Complexity -- idea that the total complexity a system stays the same, it either gets dealt with by the user or the designer
- His thesis is the complexity is fine and good, that it's here to stay, there's no getting rid of it. Instead, just as a bank manages risk, the goal of the design is to manage complexity.
- The overarching thrust of Norman's work is that good design is all about communication. This is very simple but I also find it incredibly powerful. Design 'communicates' how to interact with a product or service (e.g., through affordances), what do when things go wrong, and feedback to let you know what's happening.  
- I really appreciated the chapter on design of services and found it pretty fascinating.
- The idea of forcing functions as a design tool is pretty interesting (e.g. make it impossible for the user to do the wrong thing)
- One thing I _didn't_ like was the sidecar of his thesis--that designers and users are 'in it together' when it comes to complexity, and that users have responsibility as much as designers. I feel like this lets otherwise well-intentioned designers off the hook too easily. The examples he gives don't totally support this idea. For example, yes, musical instruments are complex and take the user years to master; driving a car can likewise take awhile to master. But mastery is different from usability. Understanding how to drive a car is quite simple; even little kids approach pianos and bang on the keys knowing that sound will emit.


### chapter 1

- Complicated != complex. Complexity is a state of the world, complication a state of the mind.
- There's a photo in the chapter of Al Gore's office and it's clearly an exercise in unchecked entropy.
- While _complexity_ is a source of richness and spice, _complicated_ is rooted in poor design

### chapter 2/3

- Something complicated can be transformed into something simple by evoking the appropriate mental model. (This is the core message of many of Hofstadter's writing esp w.r.t. analogy, as well as a core message of _made to stick_ and reinforces the idea that good design is about communication, and good communication has its roots in the same stuff.)
- The designers job is provide people with the appropriate conceptual model.
- There's an interesting side-track about people's preferences and how most people prefer products with more features, even if the products are less useable as a result. People want things that are powerful but useable and understandable--that complexity must be managed by the right 'frame of mind.'
- Simple != understandable.

### chapter 4

- Simple things wrapped in culture are often not simple. Even salt and pepper shakers (would should be simple) can have various cultural rules and signifiers attached to them.
- "Functional design...is primarily about communication." p. 98

### chapter 5

- Tech is generally bad at dealing with the unexpected. How do we make machines more helpful when unexpected things happen?
- There's a lot in the chapter that overlaps with _inmates_, mostly about how the psychology of the people that create technology typically isn't suited for the creation of useable products
- Most tech tools support low-level tasks instead of the high-level goals the user cares about (this was another theme of _inmates_)
- Tech should make it easier to 'pick up where you left off'--would increase useability and is in most cases possible
- He brings up the idea of 'desire lines': the example he uses is paths in cities across lawns or parks where people walk. People _desire_ a certain route even though the pavement doesn't support that route. Of course desire lines are more general and they reveal gaps between the idealized state of the world and the world as it currently is. Looking for these sorts of lines is probably a useful skill, as it's telling you areas where your users don't feel supported. (Though I'll note, in the case of the sidewalk, the answer might not be 'put a sidewalk where people are walking.' The answer might be 'Increase the frequency of the bus route.')

### chapter 6

- Often the only difference between a product and a service is the point of view you assume
- Think of services as _systems_: if you don't design for the system the result will be off because of all the complexities and components involved in services. (There's obviously a lot of opportunity for cross-pollination between this idea and systems thinking.)
- p. 148 has a great 'product sentiment': never solve the problem the customer has asked you to solve. Go a step beyond the symptoms and look for the root causes. Example with IDEO redesign Amtrak's NE corridor services. 
- The design of services is much more understudied compared to the design of products.

### chapter 7

This was one of those bizarre chapters tht didn't mesh, but it was still interesting.

- 'Waits' are side-effects of complex systems -- this is the flimsy basis of including this chapter in this book
- Design principles for waits:
  - provide a conceptual model
  - make it seem appropriate
  - exceed expectations
  - keep people occupied
  - be fair 
  - strong strong and end strong
- One idea from this chapter is that having a single, faster-moving line is typically perceived as being more fair than many lives (which will also move slower)

### chapter 9

- The designer's job is to tame complexity
- The path to good design is communication
- Fundamental design rule: avoid error messages
- You also know you're designing something poorly if people have to remind themselves with sticky notes or other reminders how to use your product
- Group and structure to organize complexity and make it more understandable and therefore simpler
- Instruction guide / manual should be based about high-level tasks, not features
