# models for thinking and problem-solving

#### what is the goal / problem

This seems really simple but violating this simple idea is routine. Whenever you're thinking through something, make sure ou know what the exact problem is you're solving for. I've found it's quite typical for the problem to be ill-defined and nebulous. You can't solve a problem if the problem isn't clear.

#### expected value calculations / net present value

#### sensitivity analysis

#### root cause analysis / systems thinking

Asking _why_ five times, diagram the resulting process / set of ideas.

#### weight opinions by credibility

#### supply and demand

#### imagine the future

If we did X, what do you think would happen? Try to imagine the future.

#### commit to and revise your mental models

The only way to learn about how the world works is to (a) form a hypothesis, (b) observe, (c) when something violates your hypothesis, it means your model is wrong and needs updating, so (d) update it and continue the process.

#### facts vs. generalizations vs. assumptions

It's important to be able to tease about, in any argument or opinion: what are the facts? what are the generalizations? what are the assumptions?

## specific techniques / models

#### sequential anaylsis

Be able to answer:

1. What is the problem?
2. Where does it lie? (i.e. what is the system or the process that produces the problem?)
3. Why does it exist?
4. What could we do about it?
5. What should we do about it? You should be able to visualize the world with your recommendation in place.


#### SWOT

- strengths
- weaknesses
- oppurtunities
- threats

#### policy analysis

__Effects__
1. What are the intended effects?
2. What are the unintended effects?
3. How will the policy affect different sub-populations / groups?

__Implementation__
4. What's the cost?
5. How feasible is it?
6. Do the stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
