# models for thinking and problem-solving

#### what is the goal / problem

This seems really simple but violating this simple idea is routine. Whenever you're thinking through something, make sure ou know what the exact problem is you're solving for. I've found it's quite typical for the problem to be ill-defined and nebulous. You can't solve a problem if the problem isn't clear.

#### expected value calculations / net present value

#### sensitivity analysis

#### root cause analysis / systems thinking

Asking _why_ five times, diagram the resulting process / set of ideas.

#### supply and demand

#### imagine the future

If we did X, what do you think would happen? Try to imagine the future.

#### what time horizon is relevant?

#### facts vs. generalizations vs. assumptions

It's important to be able to tease about, in any argument or opinion: what are the facts? what are the generalizations? what are the assumptions?
