# models for thinking and problem-solving

#### what is the goal / problem

This seems really simple but violating this simple idea is routine. Whenever you're thinking through something, make sure ou know what the exact problem is you're solving for. I've found it's quite typical for the problem to be ill-defined and nebulous. You can't solve a problem if the problem isn't clear.

### what do I need to know

Most of the time, we're happy creating a story in our heads to explain data we see or a pattern we observe. In doing this, we only consider a single world or a small subset of worlds: those that happen to pop into our minds to explain the pattern.

A more robust way of understanding the world is to ask, before looking at the data: What would I need to know to be confident about answering this question? Then look at the data you have. Doing this is a guard against forming a story that seems plausible to you but is, in reality, based on a smalll subset of information you need to truly understand what's going on. 

### imagine the future

If we did X, what do you think would happen? Try to imagine the future. Useful for thinking about second- and third-order effects.

### what's the null hypothesis?

There are plenty of cognitive biases that masquerade by different names (e.g. survivorship bias, failure to consider base rates), but at their core is the failure to consider the null hypothesis. Whenever you come across something that looks interesting or out-of-the-ordinary, or is presented to you as such, always ask yourself what you'd expect to happen if nothing interesting is happening in reality.

### diagrams

#### expected value calculations / net present value

#### sensitivity analysis

#### root cause analysis / systems thinking

Asking _why_ five times, diagram the resulting process / set of ideas.

#### weight opinions by credibility

#### supply and demand


#### commit to and revise your mental models

The only way to learn about how the world works is to (a) form a hypothesis, (b) observe, (c) when something violates your hypothesis, it means your model is wrong and needs updating, so (d) update it and continue the process.

#### facts vs. generalizations vs. assumptions

It's important to be able to tease about, in any argument or opinion: what are the facts? what are the generalizations? what are the assumptions?

## specific techniques / models

#### sequential anaylsis

Be able to answer:

1. What is the problem?
2. Where does it lie? (i.e. what is the system or the process that produces the problem?)
3. Why does it exist?
4. What could we do about it?
5. What should we do about it? You should be able to visualize the world with your recommendation in place.


#### SWOT

- strengths
- weaknesses
- oppurtunities
- threats

#### policy analysis

__Effects__
1. What are the intended effects?
2. What are the unintended effects?
3. How will the policy affect different sub-populations / groups?

__Implementation__
4. What's the cost?
5. How feasible is it?
6. Do the stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
