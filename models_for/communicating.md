# models for communicating

> The only way to communicate is to understand what it is like not to understand â€” Richard Saul Wurman

__Be explicit with your definitions.__ Often times communication sucks because we think we're talking about the same thing but we're reallhy talking about different things. This is the case for almost all big arguments in academia.

__Draw it out.__ Usally drawing a picture of what you're trying to communicate to someone it helpful because it clearly lays out your model of the world. Assumptions and schemas become clearer. 


__Focus on something concrete and simple first.__

When you explain something to someone, the person is ignorant of what you're explaining. They are a novice. They haven't had the luxury to let the idea you're explaining sink in, develop an intuition for them. Thus: be very concrete. The person you're communicating to show be able to form some mental figure or tangibly understand what is it you're talking about. Recall a quotation from _made to stick_:

> Abstraction is the luxury of the expert

For novices, start simple and start with something concrete.

__Use metaphors and isomorphisms__.

Steven Pinker argues that the single idea that ruins most communication is the curse of knowledge: once we know something, it is difficult to imagine what it's like _not_ to know that thing. What does Pinker advise we do? _Direct the reader's gaze to something they know_. Start with something that the person already understands and is familiar with, then generalize from there. One tool to do this: metaphors.

A great example of this is by Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. Hofstadter's book revolves around abstract math and touches on music, art, how computers work, molecular biology. It's a tough assignment. But he routinely invokes metaphors embedded in stories to orient the reader to something he can understand before zooming out and generalizing the idea he's trying to get across.
