# Models for communicating

> The only way to communicate is to understand what it is like not to understand â€” Richard Saul Wurman

The ideas below are drawn from various books and thoughts I have. I'm constantly refining them.

## Be explicit with your definitions.

Often times communication sucks because we think we're talking about the same thing but we're reallhy talking about different things. This is the case for almost all big arguments in academia.

## Draw it out

> People are not trusting. If we tell them something, they always want to see it for themselves. They like pictures and diagrams.
- _The Design of Future Things_, page 185

Usually drawing a picture of what you're trying to communicate to someone it helpful because it clearly lays out your model of the world. Assumptions and schemas become clearer.

What's more: as the quotation above suggests, you build _trust_ between you're essentially 'showing your work'. You make your thinking transparent and amenable to inspection.

## Focus on something concrete and simple first.

When you explain something to someone, the person is ignorant of what you're explaining. They are a novice. They haven't had the luxury to let the idea you're explaining sink in, develop an intuition for them. Thus: be very concrete. The person you're communicating to show be able to form some mental figure or tangibly understand what is it you're talking about. Recall a quotation from _made to stick_:

> Abstraction is the luxury of the expert

For novices, start simple and start with something concrete.

## Use metaphors and isomorphisms / give people a conceptual model

Steven Pinker argues that the single idea that ruins most communication is the curse of knowledge: once we know something, it is difficult to imagine what it's like _not_ to know that thing. What does Pinker advise we do? _Direct the reader's gaze to something they know_. Start with something that the person already understands and is familiar with, then generalize from there. One tool to do this: metaphors.

A great example of this is by Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. Hofstadter's book revolves around abstract math and touches on music, art, how computers work, molecular biology. It's a tough assignment. But he routinely invokes metaphors embedded in stories to orient the reader to something he can understand before zooming out and generalizing the idea he's trying to get across.

Another way of saying this: provide people with an appropriate conceptual model. Models are useful fictions. Use them. Don Norman's _Design of Future Things_ deals with this.

## Communicating an opinion

1. These are the data
2. These are the assumptions.
3. Here's what I think as a result.
4. What do you think?

## Parrot it back / continually reassure

Communication is two-way. If I tell you that that fence is electrified and you don't hear me or absorb it, no communication has occurred. You can proactively work to make sure the other persons knows that their message has been heard. And the way you do that is be rephrasing what they said and saying it back to me. This has two purposes:

- It lets the other person know you've heard them
- It lets the other persons know _what_ you've heard. It's often the case that someone says something incomplete and we fill in the gaps, or we hear only what we want to hear. When we parrot it back to the speaker, we introduce feedback into the system and poor communication can be corrected

More broadly, feedback is critical for any communication. If you're designing a car, you want to have some feedback in place to know if the car is working correctly, or if it needs to be serviced, or if there's an urgent problem. If you're designing a website, you need to provide feedback when a user incurs an expensive action, like submitting an order; how often do you click 'submit' and then nothing happens, and you think "Do I need to refresh my page? Did it go through? What's happening? Is my wifi out?" Feedback murders these sorts of thoughts. Parroting back what someone is saying is a form of feedback for conversing with someone.

I also think about the update emails I send weekly at work. Part of the reason I think folks have found these effective is that they are a mechanism for continual reassurance. They let others know what I'm working on.

## bonus: make them think it was their idea

I think the most optimal form of human communication comes from the ability to incept ideas into other peoples heads, or make them think an idea was theirs. My sense--I don't have much evidence for this--is that truly powerful people, people with the most influence, that are the most effective, are those that can makes others feel that they are in control.

I mention this here because it appears both in _how to wins friends and influence people_ and in Don Norman's _the design of future things_ in a section about how machines should attempt to communicate with humans. The content and purpose of these books could not be more different, but I found this connection between them intriguing and suggesting, I think, something deeper about human nature and effective transfer of information.

## books / resources

Probably the best book on communication I know of is (oddly) _made is stick_. I keep coming back to it as a resource that covers all the major topics and models for communicating.

Most design books are often fundamentally communication books. Don Norman's book, especially _The Design of Future Things_, outline fundamental concepts of communication that have made their way here.
