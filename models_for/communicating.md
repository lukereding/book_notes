# Models for communicating

> The only way to communicate is to understand what it is like not to understand â€” Richard Saul Wurman

The ideas below are drawn from various books and thoughts I have. I'm constantly refining them.

## Know your audience

This is foundational. You cannot communicate effectively if you don't know who you're trying to communicate with.

__General audiences__. Whenever you think about trying to communicate something, you should have an idealized representation of your audience in your mind. That ideal--it's more effect if it's a single person--should represent an audience member of your talk, or a reader of your article. This person embodies the assumptions, the backgrounds, notions, and reactions your audience will have when you communicate. If you can't fathom this ideal, or imagine or they might respond to what you're trying to say, you can't do your job.

__General audiences__. Sometimes, you have it easier: you know exactly who you're communicating to ahead of time (e.g., a business meeting). Here, instead of forming an idealized representation, you need to think very carefully about who you're talking to, what they care about, their values and goals. You won't always know these with certainty, but you can (a) ask them ahead of time and (b) form mental models based on previous actions with each person.


## Focus on something concrete and simple first

When you explain something to someone, the person is ignorant of what you're explaining. They are a novice. They haven't had the luxury to let the idea you're explaining sink in, develop an intuition for them. Thus: be very concrete. The person you're communicating to show be able to form some mental figure or tangibly understand what is it you're talking about. Recall a quotation from _made to stick_:

> Abstraction is the luxury of the expert

For novices, start simple and start with something concrete.

## Think about what response you're looking for 

Before you create your deck or write your memo, think: what do I want someone to think or feel after viewing/reading this? Then work backwards from where. Doing this will likely require thinking about your audience more carefully.

Some helpers:

- What do I want the other person to feel?
- What do I want the other person to know?
- What do I want the other person to do?

It's amazing how often we communicate something and we aren't clear ahead of time what success looks like. Thinking about these questions ahead of time will help you be more thoughtful about how you craft what you're trying to communicate.

## Make predictions about how your audience will respond

Again, your effectiveness as a communicator is tied closely to your knowledge of your audience, and how well you can weave that knowledge into what you're saying. The only way to get better at knowing your audience is to form mental models and then run experiments to update those models. That means making predictions, then updating your models when your predictions deviate from what you observe. If you do this, you will get better and better at understanding people, what they care about, and how they react. I knew an executive at a major company who kept a spreadsheet of everyone he was trying to influence (read: communicate effectively with), along with each interaction he had with that person, what tactic he took to communicate with them, and what response he observed.

## Use a framework

It's often useful to tell a story with what you say: humans are geared to understand and tune into stories. This doesn't make sense all the time (e.g., don't use this during morning standups), but when give a longer presentation or need to think carefully about how to structure your message, framing it as a story can help.

Here's a common framework that might help guide your thinking:

- Opening - Background information; what the problem is and why the audience should care
- Challenge - The gap between where we are today and the problem. The challenge is the most important part of the arc. This is where you convince people that there is a problem worth solving.
- Action - What you did to solve the problem. How you tackled the gap outlined in the challenge
- Resolution - What we've learned from the above. You should be able to go back to the opening at this point and 'reinterpret it' with fresh eyes given what you've done. Think of the resolution coming back to the opening, but at a different altitude, like a spiral: you're back at the same place, but not really, because you've learning something new that changes how we think about opening now

There's more on different frameworks you can use to help you communicate [here](./writing.md#story-telling-and-narrative-tension)

## Start with an outline or with images

It can be difficult to start communicating something, either via a talk or in writing. A couple ideas:

__Start with pictures.__ Start by thinking about what ideas, processes, products, etc. you want to show your audience. From there, you could work on grouping then, arranging them so they form more of a coherent story, then work backwards from there.

__Start with a rough outline / mind map__. It can be useful if you're feeling overwhelmed to start by wring out all the ideas in your head. Group them into similar groups. Given these groups names. Connect these groups to even larger groups, and so on. From there you should be able to back out what you're actually trying to say. This is the inductive strategy from the pyramid principle.

__Map out your story__. If you have a better idea of what you want to say, it can be useful to write out the bare minimum of what you want to communicate as a series of single declarative sentences written in the active tense. If you're giving a talk, these will form the titles of the slides.

## Be explicit with your definitions

Often times communication sucks because we think we're talking about the same thing but we're really talking about different things. This is the case for almost all big arguments in academia.

## Draw it out

> People are not trusting. If we tell them something, they always want to see it for themselves. They like pictures and diagrams.
- _The Design of Future Things_, page 185

Usually drawing a picture of what you're trying to communicate to someone it helpful because it clearly lays out your model of the world. Assumptions and schemas become clearer.

What's more: as the quotation above suggests, you build _trust_ between you're essentially 'showing your work'. You make your thinking transparent and amenable to inspection.

## Use metaphors and isomorphisms / give people a conceptual model

Steven Pinker argues that the single idea that ruins most communication is the curse of knowledge: once we know something, it is difficult to imagine what it's like _not_ to know that thing. What does Pinker advise we do? _Direct the reader's gaze to something they know_. Start with something that the person already understands and is familiar with, then generalize from there. One tool to do this: metaphors.

A great example of this is by Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. Hofstadter's book revolves around abstract math and touches on music, art, how computers work, molecular biology. It's a tough assignment. But he routinely invokes metaphors embedded in stories to orient the reader to something he can understand before zooming out and generalizing the idea he's trying to get across.

Another way of saying this: provide people with an appropriate conceptual model. Models are useful fictions. Use them. Don Norman's _Design of Future Things_ deals with this.

## Communicating an opinion

1. These are the data
2. These are the assumptions.
3. Here's what I think as a result.
4. What do you think?


## Parrot it back / continually reassure

Communication is two-way. If I tell you that that fence is electrified and you don't hear me or absorb it, no communication has occurred. You can proactively work to make sure the other persons knows that their message has been heard. And the way you do that is be rephrasing what they said and saying it back to me. This has two purposes:

- It lets the other person know you've heard them
- It lets the other persons know _what_ you've heard. It's often the case that someone says something incomplete and we fill in the gaps, or we hear only what we want to hear. When we parrot it back to the speaker, we introduce feedback into the system and poor communication can be corrected

More broadly, feedback is critical for any communication. If you're designing a car, you want to have some feedback in place to know if the car is working correctly, or if it needs to be serviced, or if there's an urgent problem. If you're designing a website, you need to provide feedback when a user incurs an expensive action, like submitting an order; how often do you click 'submit' and then nothing happens, and you think "Do I need to refresh my page? Did it go through? What's happening? Is my wifi out?" Feedback murders these sorts of thoughts. Parroting back what someone is saying is a form of feedback for conversing with someone.

I also think about the update emails I send weekly at work. Part of the reason I think folks have found these effective is that they are a mechanism for continual reassurance. They let others know what I'm working on.

## bonus: make them think it was their idea

I think the most optimal form of human communication comes from the ability to incept ideas into other peoples heads, or make them think an idea was theirs. My sense--I don't have much evidence for this--is that truly powerful people, people with the most influence, that are the most effective, are those that can makes others feel that they are in control.

I mention this here because it appears both in _how to wins friends and influence people_ and in Don Norman's _the design of future things_ in a section about how machines should attempt to communicate with humans. The content and purpose of these books could not be more different, but I found this connection between them intriguing and suggesting, I think, something deeper about human nature and effective transfer of information.

## books / resources

Probably the best book on communication I know of is (oddly) _made is stick_. I keep coming back to it as a resource that covers all the major topics and models for communicating.

Most design books are often fundamentally communication books. Don Norman's book, especially _The Design of Future Things_, outline fundamental concepts of communication that have made their way here.

I was glad to see a ton of overlap between this list and the chapter in _Cracking the PM Career_ on communication.
