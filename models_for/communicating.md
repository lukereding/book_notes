# Models for communicating

> The only way to communicate is to understand what it is like not to understand â€” Richard Saul Wurman

Probably the best book on communication I know of is (oddly) _made is stick_. I keep coming back to it as a resource that covers all the major topics and models for communicating.

## Be explicit with your definitions.

Often times communication sucks because we think we're talking about the same thing but we're reallhy talking about different things. This is the case for almost all big arguments in academia.

## Draw it out

Usally drawing a picture of what you're trying to communicate to someone it helpful because it clearly lays out your model of the world. Assumptions and schemas become clearer. 


## Focus on something concrete and simple first.

When you explain something to someone, the person is ignorant of what you're explaining. They are a novice. They haven't had the luxury to let the idea you're explaining sink in, develop an intuition for them. Thus: be very concrete. The person you're communicating to show be able to form some mental figure or tangibly understand what is it you're talking about. Recall a quotation from _made to stick_:

> Abstraction is the luxury of the expert

For novices, start simple and start with something concrete.

## Use metaphors and isomorphisms

Steven Pinker argues that the single idea that ruins most communication is the curse of knowledge: once we know something, it is difficult to imagine what it's like _not_ to know that thing. What does Pinker advise we do? _Direct the reader's gaze to something they know_. Start with something that the person already understands and is familiar with, then generalize from there. One tool to do this: metaphors.

A great example of this is by Hofstadter's _Godel, Escher, Bach_. Hofstadter's book revolves around abstract math and touches on music, art, how computers work, molecular biology. It's a tough assignment. But he routinely invokes metaphors embedded in stories to orient the reader to something he can understand before zooming out and generalizing the idea he's trying to get across.

## Communicating an opinion

1. These are the data
2. These are the assumptions.
3. Here's what I think as a result.
4. What do you think?

## Parrot it back

Communication is two-way. If I tell you that that fence is electrified and you don't hear me or absorb it, no communication has occurred. You can proactively work to make sure the other persons knows that their message has been heard. And the way you do that is be rephrasing what they said and saying it back to me. This has two purposes:

- It lets the other person know you've heard them
- It lets the other persons know _what_ you've heard. It's often the case that someone says something incomplete and we fill in the gaps, or we hear only what we want to hear. When we parrot it back to the speaker, we introduce feedback into the system and poor communication can be corrected
