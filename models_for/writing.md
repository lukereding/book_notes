# models for writing

These are less 'models' and more 'things to keep in mind when expressing yourself in the written word.'

#### story-telling and narrative tension

If you're writing something you want it to be read. One way to get people to read is to hook them. Think of movie trailers or the end of each television episode in a series. Both function to create tension: they present some complication but don't tell you how it ends. The tension remains unresolved. Unresolved tension is unsettling and powerful: you've probably stayed to the end of a movie you hated just to see how it ends. Similarly, your reader wants to resolve this tension and will wade through your writing to resolve it.

Storys provide a means of developing and sustaining this tension. The components of a story are: a situation / subject, a complication (something that happens to the situation / subject), and a resolution (something that directly addresses the complication).

#### outline your logic before you write

We tend to focus on _how_ we say things rather than _what_ we're saying. But if your writing lacks a sane structure or fails to make a point, it doesn't matter _how_ the words look on the page; they're useless.

You must figure out what you want to say before you figure out how to say it. It's often the case that we need to write to figure out what we want to say. That's fine. What's not fine is, once you've figured out what you want to say, to fail to examine the structure of your thought on the page. Some outline is needed to identify what ideas you want to communicate and the relationship among the ideas.

#### specific -> general

In writing about something complicated, always start with a specific, concrete example. Starting with the most general form of the idea just confuses your reader: they can't form a mental image of what it is. You need to give the reader something solid to hold onto so that she can see that she understands it. Only then can you take a leap and ask the reader to trust you that the specific thing they're holding onto is simply a specific instance of a broader phenomenon or class of ideas. Abstraction is a luxury for experts only.

#### use pre-existing schemas

If you know your audience well enough, you should have some idea about pre-existing schemas they have. These schemas become anchors for you when introducing a new idea or concept. A schema is powerful because it's something your reader already knows and understands. And once you direct the reader towards the schema, you can modify the schema to convey your new idea.

#### make a point

Don't write just to write. All writing should be biased. It should make a point. Your writing should be opinionated.

#### be specific

Truth lies in little details. Like abstract art, abstract language confuses more than it clarifies. Your writing should generate an image. The reader should be able to see what it is you're describing or communicating. The only way to do that is by using specific, concrete words.

#### use images

See above.
