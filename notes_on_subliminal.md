# Subliminal
Mlodinow

This was a fairly interesting book about the role of the subconscious in our behavior. What follows are a random assortment of notes I took while reading the book that make no claim to formal coherence.

## chapter 1

- the new psychological view holds that a lot of our mental processes are at the level of the subconscious not because repression or some other unhealthy reason, but because of the way the brain is architected
- people consume popcorn based on the size of the container as much as they do based on the taste of the popcorn
- _fluency effect_: if the form of information is hard to assimilate into our schema, this impacts our judgment of the substance of the information, e.g., hard to read fonts
- packing, even the music playing when we shop can have an unconscious affect on our behavior and purchasing habits

## chapter 2 - perception

- our sensory system intakes 11 million bits on information per second, but we can only consciously process 15-50 bits / second
- hard mental activity only increases brain metabolism by ~1%, suggesting that the brain is doing a lot of work on autopilot
- the unconscious can work in blind people whose occipital lobes are destroyed if their eyes are still intact
- "all of our perceptions can be considered illusions"
- "das ding an sich vs. das ding fur uns" — the thing as it is vs the thing as we know it
- the quality of our perceptual information is actually quite low — your brain does a lot of processing to render something high-quality and fill in the gaps


## chapter 3 - memory

- 75% of people exonerated by DNA were convicted by of false eye-witness testimony, an illustration of the illusory nature of memory
- people tend to remember the general gist of events, but will 'fill in' the details and believe the details their brain supplies, even if they are incorrect
- this makes it easier than expected to manufacture false memories in people by supplying them with false details — so as long as the general gist is correct, people tend to believe these false details, like that they say bugs bunny at disney world. there’s something very interesting and deep here about the interplay between memory, truth, and what makes things real (which, IMO, are details) — if false details can be accepted by the brain, forming a false memory, what does that say about the nature our things we think are true?
- an interesting idea: culture = group memory 

## chapter 4 - sociality

- psychical pain and social emotional pain from being snubbed share the same neural basis
- theory of mind as a prerequisite for the sophisticated human social systems
- 1st order theory of mind — what you want. 2nd order theory of mind — thinking about what someone else wants, etc. Humans do 4th order regularly, sometimes up to 6th order
- neocortex volume : brain volume ratio predicts social group size in monkeys. implies our ancestral group size was ~150


## chapter 5 - reading people

- in experiments, experiments who thoughts rats should be better at a maze actually led to better results of the rats. unclear how this is happening though
- without thinking or wanting to, we often communication our expectations to others, who respond by fulfilling those expectations
- fake smiles don’t activate a set of muscles that are activated when we really, truly smile
- "visual dominance ration" — amount of time you spend looking at someone when talking to them relative to the time you look at them when they are talking to you. ratio < 1 => lower on the social scale. this measure is fairly predictive of all sorts of social interactions where their is implied hierarchy or power dynamic.
- non-verbal communication: (1) body language (2) pitch and speed of voice (3) personal space

## chapter 6

- we are more likely to find fast-talking people to be more knowledgeable and intelligent 
- touching is important. light touches on the arm increase waiters tips and chances of date

## chapter 7

- if you want to remember things, put them into categories
- we tend to perceive things within a category as more similar than they actually are or would be if we hadn’t grouped them together
- the implicit association test works by asking you to categorize instances into categories you might not typically associate with that instance, which decreases your speed

## chapter 8 - in-groups and out-groups

- we tend to like people because they’re part of our in-group, even if we don’t like them personally 
- we tend to only appreciate variation in people within our in-group and view out-groups as homogenous
- asian woman primed to think of themselves as asian did much better on a test than those primed to think of themselves as women
- messages that condemn yet highlight undesired behavior are common, yet, seem to have the opposite of their intended effect, in part because the message is basically saying, "hey, other people do this thing" which is a powerful social cue that it’s acceptable to do
- when people from different in-groups work together towards a common goal, the less they discriminate against each other

## chapter 9 - feelings

- you can have someone attribute a feeling to a physiological response and modulate it to positive or negative depending on the circumstances
- he suggests that there are parts of our brain that attempt to make sense and explain our feelings. we often tell ourselves a story about our feelings which is false
- there are some interesting tidbits in this chapter that had me thinking: what would it take to architect our emotions? would we want to?

## chapter 10 - self

- people consistently rate themselves as being above average
- the causal arrow in our minds tends to point from belief -> evidence, not the other way around like we think it does
- we use ambiguity to fill in the cracks of the edifice of the self in ways that serve our interests or generate favorable impressions of ourselves 
- it’s sort of interesting to consider that a lot of achievements come from people simply believing or willing themselves to think they can do something great, even if there’s no really good reason to think that’s the case
- people with accurate self-perceptions tend to be mildly depressed
