# Radical technologies: the design of everyday life

Greenfield

I really liked this book. Even the changes on ML/AI alone I found more engaging and thought-provoking that the entirely of, e.g., _weapons of math destruction_. I started taking notes maybe 1/3 of the way through.

### problems with augmented reality

- makes it seem like there's something wrong with the world, that a lot of what we have and is great isn't good enough
- equality of access will always be an issue with tech like this
- in addition to papering over all the great things in the world, it can also paper over all the shit that needs work in our common world

### 3-D printing

- in general, the totally decentralization of making shit has all sorts of other 2nd- and 3-rd order effects that aren't immediately clear unless you think carefully about them
- regulation / safety concerns about making things that are regulated for a good reason
  - e.g., guns, anything else that's regulated or has the capacity to harm others or the common good
- smart contracts, labor to the lowest bidder, get around collective bargaining power of unions minimum wage
  - i think the point here was that in world were manufacturing jobs as we know them don't exist, some of the most vulnerable jobs are vaporized and the labor freed up by the change can now be exercised in unregulated spaces without protections or unions and guarantees about wages

### distributed autonomous organizations / DAOs

- a way for an organization or group to achieve some aim, e.g., a company or co-op
- based on property / owning tokens (like a stock)
- use smart contracts (back by blockchain) to enforce commitments where they can be computationally carried out
- DAOs don't allow for fluid decision-making if conditions / the world changes; the DAO _has_ to enforce the stated contracts
- little accountability / transparency to its membership, which can problematic for DAOs that have society impacts

### automation

- one view: cheap, docile, reliable labor. another view: labor provides meaning, order, a ward against the the uncertainty and unpredictability of life
- more automation beings up more towards a world of no guaranteed work or pay, and piecemeal hours--no boundaries for private life. (this is already happening imo)
- automation is usually wrapped up with efforts to measure, control, and improve the output of the remaining labor that exists, which means: relying on shitty algos and models to measure and track what employees are doing and how
  - in the 60s / 70s we already saw hints on this, e.g., in stud terkels _working_, where a strip mine operator describes how the company keeps tabs on how much coal he unearths, the amount of time the machine stays idling, etc.
- japan using robots instead of immigrant labor for 'high-tech' jobs, which is to say: relying more on automation can be a deep to further entrench society racism 
- works as purpose, a way to organize our lives

### machine learning

- raw data doesn't exist: we choose what data to collection, how, at what frecency, etc.: data is always biased and is fundamentally human. connection to _machine unintelligence_
- it's insane to me that tech like autopilot is so loosely regulated
- predictive policing criminalizes the simple fact of physical existence
- legal implications of, e.g., false positives
- predictive policing as an objective,m mathematical veneer meant to preserve existing power relationships / prejudjices / structures
- a powerful tool, even innocuous, will always be exploited in unintended ways to do harm (e.g., facial recognition tech)
  - often these tools are designed by people who lack the background / experience / imagination / awareness to undersdtand how they might be misused (e.g., twitter, connection to _ruined by design_)
- credit score impacts your ability to find housing, get a job, basic utilities


The relevant question is not "What does technology allow us to do?" but "what do we choose to do with our technology?"

A nice goal: "Everywhere there is life, beauty, adaptation, and thriving creativity."

Right now, it often feels like the state exists to guarantee markets.

The purpose of a system = what it is observed to do

Over-arching theme: intention of technology != how it's actively used and what purpose it serves
