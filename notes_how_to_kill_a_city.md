# how to kill a city 

p. e. moskowitz

This was a clarifying, sobering read.

__Displacement__. After this book, when I think of gentrification, I will think of displacement. I tend to think that people have a right to live where they live, and gentrification can only come about when we view housing as not a human right but a commodity. There are many housing protections that exist in some places, like NYC, but they aren't very strong and if a landlord wants to evict someone (e.g. to vacate the building to put a more profitable building in its place) they can usually find a find.

__Community > commodities__. The book also makes it clear the gentrification exists because a lot of us view living as a series of transactions and exchange of commodities (I want to live in this neighborhood, I want this nice mixer and this couch from west elm, I want to go to fancy brunches on Sundays, etc. etc.). The alternative is view living within the fabric of a broader community. This disconnect, which we see on a personal level, is increasingly reflected in the governments approach to public service: increasingly, public services are going away or cities are relying on resources (e.g. security; beautification (Apple and Carnegie library); transportation projects (Austin commuter rail); arts (C1 Center)) provided by businesses. The government has stopped seeing their job as fostering holistic, fair communities. The key quote here is:

> reorienting the purposes of cities away from being spaces that provide for the poor and middle class to...spaces that generate capital for the rich. (p. 22)

This is part of the reason why many cities now 'feel' so similar. (This is something I've thought about before.)

__History of cities, budgets, and people movement.__ I also gained an appreciation for what and why some forces have shaped cities since WWII:

- After WWII, make mortgages more and more accessible to regular people to boost the construction industry and get us out the depression. Prior to the 1940s, a 30-year mortgage was unheard of. Prior to the 1930s, mortgages were 3-5 year balloon loans that requires 60-80% down.
- With increased government infrastructure for mortgages and demand for homes, you get the suburbs. Racist policies meant that getting a home in the suburbs was mostly limited to white people, and mortgages for homes in cities were unavailable due to red-lining.
- With 'white flight' out of cities, you leave the poorest and most vulnerable people in the cities. There is no longer a tax base to pay for the safety net there was before.
- Cities face bankruptcy, cut social services like crazy. Apparently NYC established the playbook for this.
- Many people that grew up in the suburbs hated them, are attracted to cities, which are often cheaper than the suburbs pre-gentrification.
- Cities entice industry / capital with large tax breaks.
- In areas where there's a gap between the current housing rates and what a developer could theoretically make by charging rent, it becomes more and more attractive for developers to develop those areas, esp. when there is a small 'pioneer' band of new urbanizers who have moved into the city.
- The profit motive takes over and without strong regulation and government intervention, people are displaced, kickout of their home, pushed into the suburbs (ironically)
  
The history makes clear that the history of the suburbs and the history of 'urban rival' are very similar.

__Gentrification and race__. Gentrification also reminds us of how explicitly racist so many of our polices are. The result of gentrification is often that people are color have less say or power over the spaces they inhabit: it perpetuates the privileging of white bodies over brown bodies. After WWII, people of color where not granted access to mortgages and new communities and had to stay in poor urban areas. With gentrification, its these people of color who are being displaced form cities, usually against their will. 


Other quotes and thoughts:

> The gentrification mentality is rooted in the belief the obedience to consumer identity over recognition of lived experience is actually normal, neutral, and value free.
quote from Shulman

Engels warned that home ownership and long mortgages would have the effect of "chaining workers" to their jobs, lessoning chance of rebellion
