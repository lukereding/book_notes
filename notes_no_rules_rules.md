# No Rules Rules

Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer

There are a lot of interesting perspectives in this book. A lot of the book is about increasing the 'talent density' at your company, and Reed seems to think that only way to do that is through migration of employees (hiring and firing), i.e., employees are inherently talented or they are not. Little is said about lifting up employees or your team or improving them. The book has some interesting ideas and thoughts but practically, the system Reed sets out works for Netflix but it'll be hard to implement almost anywhere else.

Another major idea that all these tips only make sense for _creative_ companies that need to be constantly innovating. If your objective is error or risk reduction, the 'controls and processes' route as opposed to Reed's approach makes the most sense.

Still, there are some good points in this book worth mulling over, from the evils of force-ranking to giving good feedback.

Some ideas that stuck with me:

- Thinking in bets. The metaphor is: when you arrive at Netflix, you're given a stack chips. You can place those chips on a variety of 'bets' that may or may not work. You're judged on the overall quality of the bets you make, not the result of a single bet.
- If you make a bet and it fails, will you have learned something important?
- Feedback should be given with positive intent and should be _actionable_
- Sunshining is important
- If your employees are making poor decisions, ask yourself: did I give them all the context they needed to evaluate the tradeoffs and judge the decision appropriately?

## chapter 1

A lot of this chapter is just about how early on in Netflix, Reed was forced to let the bottom third of his employees go, but morale improved and the company was more efficient as a result. He realized that average performers could pull down the performance of folks that would normally perform phenomenally. Reminds me of the Jobs quote about "A players."

The way Reed organizes the book is:
- Build up talent
- Increase candor. Only then can you
- Reduce controls

The book is broken up into chapters based on these three ideas.


## chapter 2

- Feedback at Netflix is constant and a core part of their culture. It helps folks correct their actions and calibrate
- You never say something to someone that you wouldn't say to their face
- In most places, (a) the feedback only flows one way (down) and (b) the higher up you get, the less feedback you receive. This is not true at Netflix. It's common for someone 2-3 levels below someone to push back and give them direct feedback. You give feedback to your boss and other folks you work with.
- When giving and receiving feedback, it's important to provide _belonging cues_ to let people know that it's okay, that you appreciate what they're telling you
- Bosses teach their employees to give and receive feedback well
- They use the 4A model when giving and receiving feeedback:

Giving feedback:
1. Aim to assist. I.e. give feedback with positive intent
2. Actionable.
Receiving feedback:
3. Appreciate. Don't respond in a defensive or angry way
4. Accept or discard

## chapter 3

- Remove vacation policy. Signals trust. There are plenty of valuable people you want to work with you that might be turned off by vacation policies and other red tape and controls, so you remove them. That said, you still need to set basic expectations and guardrails (e.g. not everyone can take off at the same time, or advance notice is required). Some Netflix workers work very intensely for 3-5 weeks then take 1-2 weeks off.
- They also don't have an expense policy. The rule is 'Act in Netflix's best interest'. Your boss or the audit team checks for fraud. If any employee abuses this freedom, they are hired on the spot.

## chapter 4

- Reed argues that for creative jobs, the best people are _orders of magnitude_ better than just adequate people. There's a study that was conducted on programmers awhile back that showed that the best programmer in a tiny group completed tasks orders or magnitude faster than the rest. 
- At Netflix, the idea is: get these super talented people and pay them at the top of their personal market. Instead of hiring five okay employees, hire one that will do the work of the five and pay the one person a ton of money.
- Reed argues that performance bonuses tied to performance are bad. They lead to inflexibility (what if your bonus is tied to a KPI that is no longer relevant?) Ideally, you want your workers to do their best people period, without dangling extra money in front of them. Erin cites some studies that show that performance is actually worse when people are given large bonuses to do cognitive / creative work. 
- Netflix anchors salaries to the broader market and proactively raises salary. The idea being: if you're good enough to work at Netflix, they want to keep you at Netflix, so they make sure that another company can't just offer you a better salary to entice you to leave. 
- Netflix encourages their employees to take calls with recruiters and understand what other companies are paying for people with their skill set. These data points are used to update salary information proactively. This approach also makes it clear why someone is or is not getting a raise (e.g. because their 'market rate' is increasing or stagnant). 

## chapter 5

- If you're a boss, do you shield your employees from shit and potential org changes, or do you tell them the truth?
- At Netflix, you tell them the truth. So if there's a chance or a reorg and your position might be eliminated, your boss tells you about it before it's finalized, even if it doesn't end up happening. As with all things, there's a tradeoff here, but Reed is fine accepting the costs of that increased transparency
- Part of the culture of Netflix is to drive decision-making down to the most relevant level. This is almost common sense, and something that Dalio touches on in _principles_, but it's rarely realized in major companies. At Netflix, if you're in charge of some initiative, you sign the invoices, decide how much to spend, etc. There is no approval process. You don't need to get your boss's permission or your boss's boss's permission. Reed argues that transparency is a prerequisite to enabling this sort of decision-making. Without transparency, employees wouldn't be able to prioritize appropriately or judge tradeoffs against where the company is headed.
- Reminds me of the Steve Jobs quote: “it doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do
- Part of the Netflix culture is '_sunshining_'--when you make a mistake, you socialize it and let other people know so that learning can occur and so that others feel comfortable making mistakes. Employees circulate memos where they talk about 'bets' they made that didn't work out.
- __Pratfall effect__: Tendency for someone's appeal to increase or decrease after making a mistake, depending on their own perceived competence. E.g., if someone successful makes a mistake and talks openly about it, their appeal increases.
- Oddly, they also receive key metrics before they publish them to Wall Street; trading on that information means jail time. This is a case where I don't understand the gains that transparency buys you but there's a whole lot of risk.

## chapter 6

- Talks more about the 'disperses decision-making model.' Another executive that followed Reed around for a day noticed that he didn't make any decisions. 
- As a boss, this means letting go a bit and allowing your employees to make 'bets' that you don't agree with or you think will fail.
- This all comes down to trust: do you trust your employee to have the company's best interest in mind and will root out any problems beforehand? If so, you should be encouraging them to do what they think is best, even if you disagree.
- The 'innovation cycle':
  - Farm for dissent / socialize your ide. It's common to ask people to 'rate' the idea from -10 to 10 in a spreadsheet and give a brief explanation for their rating
  - If it's a big idea, test it out first
  - Make a bet
  - If it doesn't work out, sunshine it
- Managers have to enumerate the bets they've made, which ones went well and which ones didn't

## chapter 7

- Netflix as a high-performing team, not a family. You might get benched, that's part of the deal
- 'The Keeper test'
- 'Rank and yank' kills collaboration. There are stories at Microsoft about people sabotaging each other to ensure they don't end up at the bottom of the rankings

## chapter 8

- They do signed 360 feedback
- Anonymous feedback is bad because it tends to lead to vague and unactionable feedback
- They also do 'live 360 dinners', which sound awful

## chapter 9
- Leading with context and letting people make their own decisions vs control 
  - Your choice depends on your goal (minimize errors or innovate), the talent / maturity of your employees, organizational coupling (e.g., you need to be able to make independent changes without a bunch of approvals), and everyone has to be aligned
  - "highly aligned, loosely coupled"
- Reed has a 1/2 hour meeting with every director in the company every year, and a 1 hour meeting with each VP+ each quarter to facilitate alignment
- **If a direct report does something dumb, ask yourself: Did I give them all the context they needed?** In cases where this has happened to Reed, he realizes that the bulk of the blame falls to him for not setting context appropriately.
- Always be thinking, "If this bet fails, will I have learned something?"


### random asides

Reed's emails are the pinnacle of concise but effective communication. The are short, pithy, and have no excess fat that can be trimmed.
