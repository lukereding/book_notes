# how to get ahead in life using psychology, or die trying

Psychological research reveals lots of quirks about our everyday life. How we interact with people, how we interpret everyday phenomena, etc. We should be using this knowledge to improve our lives. Yet, as far as I can tell, most psychology books are about some specific phenomenon; many of these books give practical advise that we can use in our lives, but it's fragmented and scattered. The purpose of these notes is to put these fragments in one place and organize them is some rational way.

#### The Psychology of Persuation — Robert Cialdini

- When presenting two options that vary in price to a potential consumer, present the more expensive item first.

  This makes the more expensive item look better by comparison. But it can also be useful to present a string of shitty, inexpensive items first, then show a nice expensive item. This probably works by skewing the customer's idea of the distribution of the quality of the items to be purchased. 

- Always up-sell when a customer has already purchased a lot of stuff.

  What's an additional $100 when I've just spent $1,000?

- If you want someone to do something, ask them a bigger favor, then retreat to the thing you actually want them to do. 

  They feel bad for rejecting you the first time and feel like they owe it to you to be nice when you make a concession. Concessions on your part can give rise to concessions on their part. 'Reject-then-retreat.'


- Reciprocation is powerful. If you want someone to do something for you, first do something for them.

  The initial thing you do for the other person can be really small—like just randomly asking if they'd like a Coke. The rule can be used to trigger unfair exchanges—you give a little and then ask a lot in return.

- People want to be consistent.

  Thus if you can get them to admit to being some way, and extrapolate that to something you really want them to do or say, they are more likely to do it. E.g.: Are you environmental conscious? `Sure I am.` Then surely you've like to purchase then energy efficient bulb. `Eh, yeah, sure.` Importantly, you need people to make some sort of commitment that they are who they say they are (e.g. the first question in the exchange above).

  This principle can also (perhaps) explain why writing down your opinions usually serves to strengthen them (not wanted to appear inconsistent to yourself) and why in the 60s companies would hold contests for the best essay about why the they a given product so much. Or why hung juries are more likely when the jurors initially vote by raising their hands instead of using secret ballot. The action of committing something to paper can strengthen your commitment.

- When trying to get your kid not to do something, do not threaten a harsh penalty.

  This will likely work in the short-term, but not in the long-term, but it the pressure comes from some outside force, not some inner desire. See pages 94 - 97.

- Social recognition of good done can be a prime motivator of behavior.

  E.g., people use less gas when they are told that the top gas-savers will get their names printed in the paper. When the social incentive was removed, people saved even _more_ gas, presumably because they wanted to be consistent with their previously-decided want conserve gas.

#### Thinking Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman

- Your automatic lizard-brain (System 1) has more control when you're doing something that engages the more cerebral System 2. It's harder to have self-control, e.g., when you're doing something difficult than engages System 2.

- You tend to be overconfident and place too much emphasis on your intuitions. 

  Making decisions based on what you think you know and your intuitions is hard. People don't like to think about hard things if they don't have to. So if you make some decision that come really easily, maybe step back and think about whether it really makes sense.

- You can 'prime' certain thoughts with words that are associated with certain things.

  For example, reading a paragraph with words like 'wrinkled', 'old', and 'forgetful' made people in one study act more like old people. In one study, voters were more likely to vote for a school proposition on the ballot when the voting place was in a school. Priming with money can make people act more selfish and individualistic. 

- When you want people to be honest, make them think that someone is watching them.

  E.g., in a really cool study, people were likely to pay much more for coffee at a communal urn when there where photos of eyes by the coffee maker as opposed to pictures of flowers.

-  To write a persuasive message, aim to reduce cognitive strain on the part of the reader.

  "If you care about being thought credible and intelligent, do not use complex language where simpler language will do." Write legibly. Maximize the contrast between the text and background. If you use color, use red or bright blue instead of green, yellow, or pale blue (?).  Make memorable. If you quote a source, use one with a name that is easy to pronounce. 

  Inducing cognition strain, on the other hand, activates System 2. This means that critical thinking centers become engaged more easily and a problem with a persuasive message can be flagged as suspect.
