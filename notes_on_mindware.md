## notes on _mindware_

- _fundamental attribution error_: the example i always think of: thee speeding car on the road might be someone in labor trying to get to the hospital, not an impatient jerk. we fail to consider the role of the environment / siutational forces in shaping someone's behavior

- _social facilitation effect_: people perform more energetically when people are watching them. there's an example of this (i can't remember where i read this) in cokcroaches going through a maze; the roaches run fasteer under the same conditions if there are 'bystanders' watching to focal roach get through the maze

- we can be impacted by subliminal messages.

- we can sometimes get better results when making a decision if we really on intuition. this is typically true when it's a big, important decision, e.g., buying a house (i.e. the unconscious mind knows what we actually want)

- to prime your unconscious mind to work on something, start thinking about it! write a draft and put it away for awhile; raise an issue on github and then forget about it. you're priming your unconscious mind to work on it so that hopefully you can have one of that flashes of insight that comes out of nowhere.

- a recipe for cost-benefit analysis:
  - list all the actions you could take
  - list the parties affected
  - identify the costs and benefits of each party
  - pick a form of measurement
  - predict the outcome for each cost and benefit over the relevant time period
  - weight the outcome by the probabilitiy
  - discount the outcome by a decreasing amount oveer time (to get the net present value)
  - perform a sensitivity analysis 

  what he's describing here is an exepcted value calculation with some discounting built in; the sensitivity analysis is a nice touch. This sort of thinking (a) makes a lot of sense to me and (b) is congruent what I've read in other books about making decisions (Annie Duke's book, _Principles_, _the art and science of negogiation_, etc.). Nisbet shows evidence that people the regularly use this sort of thinking tend to make more money and have better outcomes.

- he also notes that a cost-benefit analysis like this is almost always going to be wrong, but that's not the point: the point is to get a general idea, to identify what would happen under each scenario, and to stimulate your own thinking about what will happen under each scanario

- quote from freud: "when making a decision of minor importance, i have always found it advantagous to consider all the pros and cons. in vital matters, however...the decision should come from the unconsciuous, from somewhere within ourselves."

- _revealed preferences_: the value of something is revealed indirectly by what people are willing to pay for it (vs what they say they would pay)

- _sunk cost principle_: only future benefits and costs should figure into your choices. (this is a very succient phrasing.)

- _oppurtunity cost_: the cost of engaging in some action thereby losing the benefits of _the next-best action_ (not the sum of all other actions you could have taken). examples: a farmer planting corn instead of soybeans; hiring candidate A over candidate B for a job.

- some of the best advice he was given: categorize your projects in terms of things that are
  - very important and urgent
  - importand and should be done soon
  - somewhat important and no rush

  But only work on the first category.
