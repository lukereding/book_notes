# the coaching habit
Stanier


overall I find this book dovetailed with a lot of other experiences I've had, whether it's the training from upstart or when I was a manager in card intelligence, or based on other books I read. the key takeaway, which, again, these other resources have also emphasized, is the need to ask more questions when coaching, to practice being curious, and to give less advice. most of use when coaching or mentoring default to giving advice. this is not helpful for helping someone think about the world independently or absorb our knowledge or perspective. we probably do it because giving advice "feels more comfortable than the ambiguity of asking a question." give advice / solutioning also makes it more likely that you aren't answering the problem that really matters (just the one you want to solve, or recognize from prior experience). the book also reinforces the importance of curiosity, which resonates strongly with me

the book is frame around a series of questions the author has found to be useful:

- "what's on your mind?" this is a good open-ended question to get to a real conversation about what actually matters
- "and what else?" helps to draw out additional options, which leads to better decisions. makes sure you don't rush into solutioning
- "what the real challenge here for you?" helps to focus the conversation. invites the participant to further sharpen the problem themselves
- "what do you want?" often, our wants are thin wrappers around our core needs, things like identify or stability or protection or freedom. understanding those low-level needs is often more useful than understanding the symptoms (i.e., the wants)
- "how can I help?" this is something David did pretty consistently and I found it very useful. it also stops you from rushing in and doing something, especially something that isn't actually helpful.
- if you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to? I don't actually think this is a super useful coaching question, but it's generally a good one to keep in mind, and reminded me of _essentialism_
- "what was most useful to you?" forces them to think about what was useful, helps them encode the lesson in their brain, helps reinforce your value. helps create a "learning moment."


other thoughts from the book:

- there are some interesting passages here about the need for establishing safety in a conversation that align quite well with _crucial conversations_. "when your brain feels safe, it can operate on its most sophisticated level." i find that quotation incredibly clarifying and helpful. 
- an interesting question: suppose that while you're sleeping, a miracle happens. how will you know tomorrow that things have suddenly gotten better? this question, like a lot of questions I've taken notes on in similar books, has the power of asking something somewhat straightforward that allows for a answerer to respond without thinking too much, but the answer they give would have been impossible for the answerer to provide with a more nebulous prompt.
- when someone asks for advice, a good practice is to respond with, "that's a good question, and I have some thoughts which I'll share with you. but before I do, what are your thoughts?"
- 'softening' qualifiers: "just out of curiosity...", "to help me understand better..."
- some of this reminded my of the concept of playbacks and split-tracks from the Alex trainings. the idea there was repeating things back to the person (a) to make sure you understood and (b) provide a sort of mirror so that they could understand their own problem better, and thus were in a better position to solve it

interesting quotations:
> we are what we give our attention to

> being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.

> what's essential is to interrupt the process of forgetting 

> the real secret sauce here is building a habit of curiosity
